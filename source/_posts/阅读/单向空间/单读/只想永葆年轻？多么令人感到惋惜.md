<p>诺贝尔文学奖得主托尼·莫里森在 2004 年为韦尔斯利学院作的毕业致辞</p><p><img src="https://img.owspace.com/Public/uploads/Picture/2021-07-19/60f4fce8ce867.jpg" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></p><blockquote>正值毕业季，又一群二十出头的年轻人将告别蒙昧但珍贵的时光，步入人生的下一个阶段。他们难掩对未来的憧憬和不安，也对过去恋恋不舍，为青春赋予一层又一层的意义。所以每年各大高校的毕业致辞，都是大家津津乐道的对象，渴望从中获得自己价值的确证，以及“人生道路该怎么走”的指引。 
今天分享的毕业致辞来自诺贝尔文学奖得主托尼·莫里森。2004 年，她受邀为韦尔斯利学院作毕业致辞。她没有说一些你们正在最好的时光，未来会更美好之类的陈词滥调。她否定了市场规则下的青春，鼓励学生去尽情体验自己的人生，在一次次经历后获得的成熟，才最珍贵；她也否定了上一代给下一代的标签，在这个问题重重的世界里，每一代年轻人仍然可以创造自己的人生，然后担负起让世界变得更好的责任。</blockquote><hr>
                
                <h2><strong>毕业致辞</strong></h2><p><span style="color: rgb(127, 127, 127);">撰文 | 托尼·莫里森</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(127, 127, 127);">翻译 | 薛珂、谢小婧</span></p><p>校长女士、校董会、教职员工们、亲友们、学生们，我必须向你们坦白，当我受邀为韦尔斯利学院 2004 级毕业典礼致辞时，我的心情有些复杂。当然我的第一反应是高兴，我非常乐意正式地亲自参加这样一个极富盛誉的学院举办的典礼。韦尔斯利学院有 125 年的女性教育历史，学生出类拔萃，一直以来都致力于改变世界，并成功应对了女子学院长久以来所面临的种种挑战。这些成就非同凡响——因此我很高兴受邀返回校园参加此次典礼。<br></p><p>但我第二反应却不是那么高兴。我非常焦虑，因为我必须要说些什么，在特定的时间对这届特定的学生说些什么，我困扰于我可以在 2004 年对 500 多名受过高等教育的女性说些什么，或是对她们刚松了一口气、对未来充满希望但又惴惴不安的亲友们说些什么，又应该对教职工以及拥有领导才能并理解其内涵的行政部门说些什么。好吧，当然我可以肯定地告诉亲戚朋友们，青春总是令人蒙羞，因为它带着一代又一代人成长起来并取代我们，甚至还会完全战胜我们。<br></p><p>我还想提醒教职员工和学院行政部门一件大家都清楚的事情：他们所做的工作是独一无二的，这是最棒的职业。当然，对毕业生们，我可以说一说对于你们来讲恰当的话题——未来、过去、现在，和最重要的幸福。关于未来，我本不得不说些陈词滥调，比如未来是你们的，或是什么未来由你决定。但事实是，未来不是你的，也不由你决定。未来同样由其他人决定，其他人会参与其中并影响你的体验。<br></p><p><img src="http://img.owspace.com/Public/uploads/Editor/2021-07-19/1626668027163267.jpeg" title="1626668027163267.jpeg" alt="640-961.jpeg" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></p><h5>托尼·莫里森在毕业典礼上</h5><p>但我不会多讲关于未来的事情了，我对描述和预测（未来）很迟疑，因为我甚至不确定它是否存在。我的意思是，我不确定一个由政治利益、企业利益、军事利益组成的新兴集团是否会占上风，彻底毁灭宜居的人道未来。因为我认为我们不能再依赖于权力分立、言论自由、宗教自由或绝对的公民自由，并把它们当作理所当然的事情。当时间长河中数量有限的人类做出有无限破坏力的决定时，我们不能再依赖它们；当数量有限的人类对难以企及的美德和绝对权力拥有无限需求时，我们不能再依赖它们。所以，讨论未来并不快乐。<br></p><p>或许讲一讲过去会好一些。你们已经继承了这所决不妥协、智慧超群的女子院校的古老传统，而理解并保护其历史和传统是很重要的，它值得被敬重、传承。你们已经学会了如何评鉴你们所继承的历史、经济和文化。但今天的演讲并不聚焦于你们同样继承的这个国家的辉煌历史。<br></p><p>你们会在这种继承中发现一种模糊的歉意，以及随之而来的悲伤，因为它对你们来说还不够好。过去已经为而今的管理不善埋下了祸根。此外，可能和你听到或学到的相反，就是过去没有完成，也没有结束，它仍在发生的过程中，换句话说，当它重新被评论、分析时，就会产生关于它（过去）的新信息。过去已经在改变，因为它正被重新审视、重新倾听以获得更深层的共鸣。实际上，如果你们愿意鉴别出它所回避的、所扭曲的、所谎骗的，并解开它其中的秘密，那么过去可能会比想象中的未来更加自由。<br></p><p>但是对于你们这些正在创造、改变过去的人来说，由我来深究过去可能是不合适的，非常不合适。所以我想还是说回你们作为毕业生的责任——作为韦尔斯利的学生和世界公民的责任，我想重申并期许（这个责任），你们要去拯救世界，只要投入精力、正确思考，你们一定可以让这个世界变好，甚至拯救世界。这个重担从上一代人转到你们新一代人身上，因为这是我们应该共同承担的责任，不是救世界于水火，而仅仅是去爱它，不去伤害它，它已经遍体鳞伤了。不去伤害它，并且不要让正在或想要伤害它的人得逞。了解并辨析出那些把钞票当旗帜的掠夺者。他们会信口雌黄，巧言令色，不择手段地把地球变为一个赌场，这里只有纸牌才是赢家，但渺小的人类喜欢以自己有限的生命去和无限赌博。但我想更好的是你们自行挑选责任。如果必须我代替你们选，那我想你们的教育可能是徒劳的，你们没办法决定自己的责任。<br></p><p>所以现在只剩下刚刚忽略掉的最后一个主题了。幸福，我想你们已经被告知现在是你们人生中最美好的时光了。也许是这样。但如果现在真的是你人生中最美好的时光，如果你已经度过或正在经历最美好的年岁，或者未来几年是的话，我将为你感到惋惜。因为你会想驻足现在，停留在这所谓的最美年华，永不成熟，只想看起来、感觉起来年轻，只想成为市场强迫你成为的那种年轻人。<br></p><p>再多一件完美的衣服，再多一个精巧的玩具，真正完美的饮食，无害但必要的营养品，永远都说是最后一次的整容手术，终极化妆品——这些产品被设计出来以维持对长生不老的欲求。儿童被情色化为成人，成人被异化为永恒的儿童。我知道，你们的工作、交友选择、职业倾向的真正目标（即便是隐蔽的）便是为了获得幸福。你值得拥有它而且我希望你能得到它，每个人都应该得到。但如果这些是你思想中的全部，我真的很同情你，如果目前真的是你最好的年华，我很为你感到惋惜，因为，相信我，没有什么比真正的成熟更令人满足、更令人兴奋了。成熟，是你过往的生命跨度（的集合）。成熟的过程不是必然的。这种成就是一种难得的美丽，一项难得的荣耀，你不应该允许商业的力量和无趣的文化剥夺你得到它的权利。</p><p>那么，如果我不会鼓舞人心、不会充满希望地来谈论未来、过去或现在，以及你现在的责任，或者是幸福，你可能在想我为什么会来这里。如果事情像我所说的那么严肃、未知，你们可能会问，这些和我有什么关系？我自己的生活呢？正如很多人说的，我没有要求妈妈把我生下来。请允许我有不同的想法。是的，你要求了！事实上，是你坚持这样的！不出生，太容易、太普通、太常见了。所以你在地球上的存在很大程度是你自己的功劳。<br></p><p>所以这取决于你们的自我，坚持生活的自我，坦白讲，我自己也没搞懂我口中的这个世界，这个你们所继承的世界。我所有关于未来、过去、责任、幸福的思考都是我们这一代，而不是你们这一代的。我们这一代的挥霍、无视和否认，这一代脆弱的自我需要不断地汲取力量，需要别人身上反复出现的软弱来支撑自己对力量的幻想。我们卖给你们把死亡作为娱乐的游戏和影片越多，我们就越沾沾自喜。简而言之，我所解读的掌纹不是你们的，而是（在读）我们这一代的展开的手掌，没有任何一代人能够完全掌握下一代人的想象和行为，我们这代不能，你们父母这代也不能，如果你们这一代不愿意的话，你们也不能。你们不必接受那些媒体标签。你们不必接受任何定义。你们不必仅仅是纳税人、红州选民或蓝州选民、消费者、少数群体或多数群体。<br></p><p>当然，你是普通的，但你同时也是特别的。作为公民，作为个人，你在这个星球上是独一无二。没有人完全拥有你的记忆。你现在所知晓的并不是你所能知晓的全部。你书写你自己的故事，所以你可以自由想象和体验做一个没有钱的人意味着什么。你可以体验不去支配他人，没有粗鲁傲慢，没有对与你不同的人的恐惧是什么感受，不用去循环、预演、重生你在沙盒游戏中学到的的仇恨是什么感受。虽然你不能控制剧情的走向（我可以告诉你没有作者可以做到），但是你仍然可以创造它。<br></p><p>虽然你永远无法完全了解或是成功操纵那些掠过或扰乱你剧情的人，但你可以通过关心他们、公平对待他们来尊重他们。你所选的剧情风格可能会改变，或是完全无法达成，但书写自己的故事意味着你永远可以选择它的基调。这也意味着你可以发明自己的语言和措辞来表明你是谁，你的想法是什么。另一方面，我是一个讲故事的人，所以我很乐观，我相信人心向善，我相信人心厌恶虚伪、渴望真理，我相信美好也有恶的一面。因此，在我这个讲故事的人看来，你们的生命已经很有艺术性了，它在等待，等你将它变成艺术品。<br></p><p>谢谢！<br></p><p><img src="http://img.owspace.com/Public/uploads/Editor/2021-07-19/1626668082590977.gif" title="1626668082590977.gif" alt="640-58.gif" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></p><p><strong>Toni Morrison's Commencement Address to the Wellesley College Class of 2004</strong><br></p><p>I have to confess to all of you, Madame President, Board of Trustees, members of the faculty, relatives, friends, students. I have had some conflicted feelings about accepting this invitation to deliver the Commencement Address to Wellesley’s Class of 2004. My initial response, of course, was glee, a very strong sense of pleasure at, you know, participating personally and formally in the rites of an institution with this reputation: 125 years of history in women’s education, an enviable rostrum of graduates, its commitment sustained over the years in making a difference in the world, and its successful resistance to challenges that women’s colleges have faced from the beginning and throughout the years. An extraordinary record—and I was delighted to be asked to participate and return to this campus.<br></p><p>But my second response was not so happy. I was very anxious about having to figure out something to say to this particular class at this particular time, because I was really troubled by what could be honestly said in 2004 to over 500 elegantly educated women, or to relatives and friends who are relieved at this moment, but hopeful as well as apprehensive. And to a college faculty and administration dedicated to leadership and knowledgeable about what that entails. Well, of course, I could be sure of the relatives and the friends, just tell them that youth is always insulting because it manages generation after generation not only to survive and replace us, but to triumph over us completely.<br></p><p>And I would remind the faculty and the administration of what each knows: that the work they do takes second place to nothing, nothing at all, and that theirs is a first order profession. Now, of course to the graduates I could make reference to things appropriate to your situations--the future, the past, the present, but most of all happiness. Regarding the future, I would have to rest my case on some bromide, like the future is yours for the taking. Or, that it’s whatever you make of it. But the fact is it is not yours for the taking. And it is not whatever you make of it. The future is also what other people make of it, how other people will participate in it and impinge on your experience of it.</p><p>But I’m not going to talk anymore about the future because I’m hesitant to describe or predict because I’m not even certain that it exists. That is to say, I’m not certain that somehow, perhaps, a burgeoning ménage a trois of political interests, corporate interests and military interests will not prevail and literally annihilate an inhabitable, humane future. Because I don’t think we can any longer rely on separation of powers, free speech, religious tolerance or unchallengeable civil liberties as a matter of course. That is, not while finite humans in the flux of time make decisions of infinite damage. Not while finite humans make infinite claims of virtue and unassailable power that are beyond their competence, if not their reach. So, no happy talk about the future.</p><p>Maybe the past offers a better venue. You already share an old tradition of an uncompromisingly intellectual women’s college, and that past and that tradition is important to both understand and preserve. It’s worthy of reverence and transmission. You’ve already learned some strategies for appraising the historical and economical and cultural past that you have inherited. But this is not a speech focusing on the splendor of the national past that you are also inheriting.<br></p><p>You will detect a faint note of apology in the descriptions of this bequest, a kind of sorrow that accompanies it, because it’s not good enough for you. Because the past is already in debt to the mismanaged present. And besides, contrary to what you may have heard or learned, the past is not done and it is not over, it’s still in process, which is another way of saying that when it’s critiqued, analyzed, it yields new information about itself. The past is already changing as it is being reexamined, as it is being listened to for deeper resonances. Actually it can be more liberating than any imagined future if you are willing to identify its evasions, its distortions, its lies, and are willing to unleash its secrets.<br></p><p>But again, it seemed inappropriate, very inappropriate, for me to delve into a past for people who are in the process of making one, forging their own, so I consider this focusing on your responsibility as graduates—graduates of this institution and citizens of the world—and to tell you once again, repeat to you the admonition, a sort of a wish, that you go out and save the world. That is to suggest to you that with energy and right thinking you can certainly improve, certainly you might even rescue it. Now that’s a heavy burden to be placed on one generation by a member of another generation because it's a responsibility we ought to share, not save the world, but simply to love it, meaning don’t hurt it, it’s already beaten and scoured and gasping for breath. Don’t hurt it or enable others who do and will. Know and identify the predators waving flags made of dollar bills. They will say anything, promise anything, do everything to turn the planet into a casino where only the house cards can win—little people with finite lives love to play games with the infinite. But I thought better of that, selecting your responsibilities for you. If I did that, I would assume your education had been in vain and that you were incapable of deciding for yourself what your responsibilities should be.<br></p><p>So, I’m left with the last thing that I sort of ignored as a topic. Happiness. I’m sure you have been told that this is the best time of your life. It may be. But if it’s true that this is the best time of your life, if you have already lived or are now living at this age the best years, or if the next few turn out to be the best, then you have my condolences. Because you'll want to remain here, stuck in these so-called best years, never maturing, wanting only to look, to feel and be the adolescent that whole industries are devoted to forcing you to remain.<br></p><p>One more flawless article of clothing, one more elaborate toy, the truly perfect diet, the harmless but necessary drug, the almost final elective surgery, the ultimate cosmetic—all designed to maintain hunger for stasis. While children are being eroticized into adults, adults are being exoticized into eternal juvenilia. I know that happiness has been the real, if covert, target of your labors here, your choices of companions, of the profession that you will enter. You deserve it and I want you to gain it, everybody should. But if that’s all you have on your mind, then you do have my sympathy, and if these are indeed the best years of your life, you do have my condolences because there is nothing, believe me, more satisfying, more gratifying than true adulthood. The adulthood that is the span of life before you. The process of becoming one is not inevitable. Its achievement is a difficult beauty, an intensely hard won glory, which commercial forces and cultural vapidity should not be permitted to deprive you of.<br></p><p>Now, if I can’t talk inspiringly and hopefully about the future or the past or the present and your responsibility to the present or happiness, you might be wondering why I showed up. If things are that dour, that tentative, you might ask yourself, what’s this got to do with me? What about my life? I didn’t ask to be born, as they say. I beg to differ with you. Yes, you did! In fact, you insisted upon it. It’s too easy, you know, too ordinary, too common to not be born. So your presence here on Earth is a very large part your doing.<br></p><p>So it is up to the self, that self that insisted on life that I want to speak to now—candidly—and tell you the truth that I have not really been clearheaded about, the world I have described to you, the one you are inheriting. All my ruminations about the future, the past, responsibility, happiness are really about my generation, not yours. My generation's profligacy, my generation's heedlessness and denial, its frail ego that required endless draughts of power juice and repeated images of weakness in others in order to prop up our own illusion of strength, more and more self congratulation while we sell you more and more games and images of death as entertainment. In short, the palm I was reading wasn’t yours, it was the splayed hand of my own generation and I know no generation has a complete grip on the imagination and work of the next one, not mine and not your parents’, not if you refuse to let it be so. You don’t have to accept those media labels. You need not settle for any defining category. You don’t have to be merely a taxpayer or a red state or a blue state or a consumer or a minority or a majority.<br></p><p>Of course, you’re general, but you’re also specific. A citizen and a person, and the person you are is like nobody else on the planet. Nobody has the exact memory that you have. What is now known is not all what you are capable of knowing. You are your own stories and therefore free to imagine and experience what it means to be human without wealth. What it feels like to be human without domination over others, without reckless arrogance, without fear of others unlike you, without rotating, rehearsing and reinventing the hatreds you learned in the sandbox. And although you don’t have complete control over the narrative (no author does, I can tell you), you could nevertheless create it.<br></p><p>Although you will never fully know or successfully manipulate the characters who surface or disrupt your plot, you can respect the ones who do by paying them close attention and doing them justice. The theme you choose may change or simply elude you, but being your own story means you can always choose the tone. It also means that you can invent the language to say who you are and what you mean. But then, I am a teller of stories and therefore an optimist, a believer in the ethical bend of the human heart, a believer in the mind's disgust with fraud and its appetite for truth, a believer in the ferocity of beauty. So, from my point of view, which is that of a storyteller, I see your life as already artful, waiting, just waiting and ready for you to make it art.<br></p><p>Thank you.<br></p>
