                    Major depressive disorder or depression is one of the most debilitating mental health conditions. Usually, conventional pharmacotherapy such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) requires several weeks (4 weeks to 12 weeks) of use to show improved symptoms. Novel interventions such as Ketamine therapy in Montreal show rapid action on mental health problems such as depression.                </p>
