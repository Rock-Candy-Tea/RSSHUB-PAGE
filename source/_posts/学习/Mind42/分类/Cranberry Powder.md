                    Cranberry could be a short ligneous plant with comparatively short trailing branches that live around twenty cm long. The stem is strong having many, thick, ovate leaves on its length. Cranberry bears conspicuous, round, red berries once in fruit. Cranberries are abounding in numerous healthy vitamins and plant compounds, a number of that are shown to be effective against tract infections (UTIs).                </p>
