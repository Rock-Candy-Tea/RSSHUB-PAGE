                    A virtual number, in any case called direct inward dialing (DID) or access numbers, is a telephone number without a clearly related telephone line. Commonly, these numbers are altered to propel moving toward calls to one of the pre-set telephone numbers, picked by the client: fixed, flexible or VoIP. A virtual number can work as an entry between standard calls (PSTN) and VoIP.                </p>
