                    The first thing that you should be checking on is that you are connected to the right router that you are trying to access the login portal for. If you are connected with some other network, or your device is using a bridged internet connection from some other ISP or router, the login page will simply not work. Make sure that you are connected to the same router and that there are no other networks connected on your device. This will ensure optimal connectivity and the problem will be solved before you know it.                </p>
