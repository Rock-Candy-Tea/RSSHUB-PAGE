                    FIFA has authorized Futsal as the only indoor soccer version. It's played on a firm surface indoors with a smaller, harder ball. The field is comparable to a basketball court in that it has no walls. At any given time, there are five players on the ice, including the goalie. Players can make as many exchanges as they choose, which means they can go all-out for their whole shift before taking a break.                </p>
