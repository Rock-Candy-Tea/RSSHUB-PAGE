                    The Linksys Velop AC3900 setup is much simpler than most others as all you are required to do is plug in the first node that is connected to your internet gateway, download the Linksys Wi-Fi app on the phone and let it automatically detect and connect to the node you just plugged in via Bluetooth without having the need to actually enter any Wi-Fi passwords. Another appreciable point about the device is the positioning of the LED lights and the fact that the indications are so easy to understand. The device features a single LED on top of it that has three basic states that are a pulsating pink, a pulsating red, and a static blue. The pulsating pink refers to the device being in a setup mode, the pulsating red shows connection or setting error while the static blue indicates the success of a connection. It is easy to just glance over and know what is up with your device.                </p>
