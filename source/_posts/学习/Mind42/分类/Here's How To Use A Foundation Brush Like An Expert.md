                    You can do it with your hands or with an elegant kabuki brush. Put an adequate layer on the large pores of the face and let it settle completely. If you wish to apply concealer to any uneven parts or beneath the eyes, use it now. A kabuki brush, a small loose powder brush, or just an eye shimmer brush make the standard brushes for using a concealer. When using concealer, dab it on the applied parts and then melt it down.                </p>
