                    The current news coverage of the Cray’Ark cruise event held in Mumbai by the various media agencies is the perfect example of the media’s state of affairs today. This is not the first time that the media has blatantly reported and shared partial fake news which involves zero credibility when handling a celebrity-profile case in the case of SSR and the likes.                </p>
