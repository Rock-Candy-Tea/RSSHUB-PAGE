                    The penalties for a Boca Raton DUI conviction are in many ways more serious than other misdemeanor criminal offenses and can greatly impact your home and work life for years to come. A DUI can be particularly damaging if your job requires you to possess a driver’s license or a clean driving record, or if you cannot get around without a car. The Boca Raton DUI attorneys at Lavalle, Brown & Ronan, P.A. can help. If you have been arrested and charged with DUI in Boca Raton, contact our office at 561.395.0000 for immediate assistance.                </p>
