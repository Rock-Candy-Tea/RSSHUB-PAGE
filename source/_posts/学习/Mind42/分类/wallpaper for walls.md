                    We love how 3D wallpaper can really make an accent wall pop, but feel free to use this type of wallpaper to cover an entire room for maximum effect. The quilted fabric designs by Annet Van Egmond look fabulous in a darker space such as a den, small living room or the infamous man cave. Van Egmond thinks of wallpaper as a modern-day tapestry and the designs give us a modern version of traditional interior design techniques. Something else we love about 3D wallpaper is that it can cover up minor wall damage and imperfections (although we do recommend installing wallpaper on as smooth a surface as possible). All of our contemporary 3D wallpaper for home décor is created using the most modern technology, including state-of-the-art scanning techniques to create images and graphics that will improve the look of any space.                </p>
