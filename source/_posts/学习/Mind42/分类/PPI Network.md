                    Protein-protein interaction (PPI) is a highly specific physical contact established between two or more protein molecules, which is the result of biochemical events generated by the interaction, these interactions include electrostatic forces, hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic effect. Many are physical contacts of molecular associations that occur in cells or living organisms in a specific biomolecular environment.PPI Network https://www.computabio.com/ppi-network-service.html                </p>
