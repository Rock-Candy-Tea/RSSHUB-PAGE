                    Not long ago in American history, bison was the preferred red meat of most of the population, with beef a close second. Of course, that has changed dramatically, with beef now being the most popular meat in America, followed by chicken and pork. So, if you’re thinking about cooking with bison meat, consider how it compares to beef, another type of cattle meat. Canadian bison meat has a slew of health advantages.                </p>
