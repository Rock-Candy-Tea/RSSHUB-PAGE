                    The type of weight plate you use depends on the exercise you want to perform as well as the weight you want to lift. Some people prefer leaving their weight plates up against a wall or on the floor, while other prefers using a Weight Plate Storage Tree. https://www.atoallinks.com/2022/qualities-to-look-for-in-a-weight-plate-storage-tree/                </p>
