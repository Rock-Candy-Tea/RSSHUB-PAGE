                    Ticks are like arachnids, which are mostly of 3 to 5 mm long, and are existing on the earth for a minimum 90 million years. Tick bites show symptoms after a few days or weeks. What will be the symptom of the tick bite will depend on the nature of the microbe which is transmitted by the tick.                </p>
