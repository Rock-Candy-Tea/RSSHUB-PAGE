                    An outdoor field would be more than adequate if the weather was completely predictable or if it would just stay clear and 65 degrees outside. It is something that you only wish for. Bend some steel instead of the weather will not bend to your will. Knowing how to build an indoor soccer field irrespective of rain or shine will help a lot.                </p>
