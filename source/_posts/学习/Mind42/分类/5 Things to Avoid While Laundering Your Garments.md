                    Most people don’t wash their dirty clothes on weekdays. Instead, they pile up them all for weekends. Thus, when on weekends, they have to wash all garments, bedding… they have used during the week. They have to wash them, dry them, iron them, and then fold them after ironing them. This all consumes almost an entire day. So, you must not wait for the weekend to come. Instead, you should wash your dirty garments twice a week.                </p>
