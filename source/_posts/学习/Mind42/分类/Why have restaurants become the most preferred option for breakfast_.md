                    In many countries, the trend of eating at restaurants is attaining rapid popularity. The reason is obvious. Instead of cooking meals at home and struggling with utensils, many people prefer eating meals at restaurants. Not just dinner and lunch, many people even eat breakfast at the restaurant.                </p>
