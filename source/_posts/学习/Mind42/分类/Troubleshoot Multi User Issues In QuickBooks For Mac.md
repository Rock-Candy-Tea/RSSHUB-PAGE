                    Within the Troubleshoot Multi-User Issues in QuickBooks for Mac accounting software, there is a function known as the Multi User Mode that enables many users to see the same business file at the same time. Remember that in order to access the Company File and make advantage of QuickBooks’s multi-user mode, each user has to have a valid license.                </p>
