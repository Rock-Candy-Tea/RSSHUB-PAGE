                    Almost all residents of UAE are aware of the fact that possession, imports, transportation and usage of narcotic and psychotropic substances are forbidden in the country. Considering varying laws of UAE, it is pertinent for anyone trapped in a criminal act to contact Dubai Criminal Lawyers to seek legal assistance.                </p>
