                    documented the world tour full of unremarkable difficulties and shared it with his loved ones through social media. Tom Turcich’s constant travel companion throughout has been his dog. Turcich adopted Savannah when she was just four months old while he was passing through Texas. Tom and Savannah have travelled 22,500 miles together in 35 countries. He said his travel companion Savannah was the first dog to go on a world walk. He said I carried Savannah along with me when she was just four. Turcich wrote that Savannah can now run 30 miles daily and still runs circles at night. The world walking wasn’t easy if the true and loyal travel companion was not with me.                </p>
