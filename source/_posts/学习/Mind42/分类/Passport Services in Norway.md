                    Buy the new Passport Services in Norway original biometric Norwegian passport with 2020 year issuing date online. The document has 32 pages. Norwegian Passports (in Norsk: Norge pass) are issued to nationals of Norway for the purpose of international travel. The passport may also serve as proof of Norwegian citizenship. The passport shares the standardised layout of most EU countries, as Norway has implemented the EU passport regulation. The colour is burgundy-red and similar, but not identical to the design of most EU countries. Despite the fact Norway is not part of the EU, the country is a signatory of the Schengen Agreement and a member state of the European Economic Area (EEA). Consequently, Norwegian citizens generally have the same rights as EU citizens in EEA countries and are treated as EU citizens for the purposes of travel and entry into EEA countries.                </p>
