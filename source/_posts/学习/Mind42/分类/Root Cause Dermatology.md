                    Root Cause Dermatology provides educational videos on the root causes of hair, skin and nail diseases such as: acne, eczema, psoriasis, hair loss, seborrheic dermatitis and dandruff. Dr. Greenberg, ND is a naturopathic doctor who specializes in dermatology and is passionate about educating others on the principles of healthy skin. She has done the research for people and developed educational videos that explain the importance of how all the systems in our body are connected. Bodies are meant to function properly, and when someone is having long-term skin issues, it means that the things are going wrong inside the body, not just on the skin. Root Cause Dermatology educates people on how the gut microbiome impacts skin and is actually at the root cause of most chronic skin conditions. These videos shed light on the root causes of acne; the root causes of eczema; the root causes of psoriasis; the root causes of hair loss; and the root causes of seborrheic dermatitis and dandruff.                </p>
