                    The game of soccer and football are the popular sports in the world. Unlike American football, soccer is a sport played by people of all ages worldwide and backgrounds. What soccer is so popular? It can be the easiness of play and set-up or maybe the fact that it can be played with a flat surface anywhere and requires a minimal amount of equipment. As it can be played on any flat surface, it’s good to put soccer projects for school also because it has a lot of benefits about which the students are not aware.                </p>
