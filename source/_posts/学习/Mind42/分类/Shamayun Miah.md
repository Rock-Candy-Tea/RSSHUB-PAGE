                    In an interview, Shamayun Miah, who has held leadership and advisory positions in the tech industry, shares his take on how technology, innovation and human ingenuity could be used to save our planet . Shamayun Miah has extensive counseling experience, and he cares about his community and the environment.As human beings, we are largely shaped by the times in which we live. We have always had to adapt to our constantly changing environment. While there have been significant leaps in the tech industry over the past few years that have allowed us to progress and accomplish things that were once thought impossible, there is still room for improvement for this innovative sector. We can use human ingenuity to adapt even more for our own good and that of our planet, said Shamayun Miah.                </p>
