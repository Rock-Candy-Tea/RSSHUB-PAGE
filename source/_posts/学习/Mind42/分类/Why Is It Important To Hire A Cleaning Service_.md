                    Many of you may have rodents like mice and other pests at home. House cleaning specialists believe that seeing an occasional mouse in your room is not a sign of an infestation, but when this happens it definitely means that you need to consult a rodent control service. An infestation is more evident when you come across chew marks on walls, wiring, clothes and soft stationery items. Next, you may even witness mouse droppings and foul smell in the room. Lastly, you may get to hear scraping and squealing noises behind cupboards and walls. However, if you are tired and is desperately looking for an ideal solution to this, then you need to look for reputable companies offering extreme cleaning services at Travis County.                </p>
