                    RAYDEAN manufactures SOLAR HIGH MAST systems up to 12 meters in height. Solar high mast systems are designed to address the problem of ARENA lighting in remote areas where running a solitary electrical cable may not be feasible and conventional solar street lighting poles up to 6 meters in height are exposed to many risks such as vandalism and maintenance issues.Address: G-1-22, Road No 2, Sirsi Rd, RIICO Industrial Area, Bindayaka, Jaipur, Rajasthan 302012Visit: https://raydeanindustries.com/solar-high-mast-systems/Contact Us: 0141 224 0099Keyword: #Solarhighmastsystem                </p>
