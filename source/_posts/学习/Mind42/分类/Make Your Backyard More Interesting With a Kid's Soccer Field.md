                    Backyards are often one of the most neglected areas of a home. Some wealthy individuals may have swimming pools in their backyards, while others may engage in casual gardening. Aside from these instances, however, most homeowners leave their backyards alone. Installing a backyard game court might drastically change the situation. You can spice up your backyard with a kid's soccer field.                </p>
