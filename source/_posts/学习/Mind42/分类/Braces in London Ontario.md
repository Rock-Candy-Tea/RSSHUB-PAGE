                    Invisible braces can refer to two different appliances: clear aligners and braces with clear brackets. Both types of appliances will straighten the teeth and produce a healthier smile.Between the two options, clear aligners are the only ones that are truly invisible when worn. Clear brackets are harder to see, but up close, people will know they are there. https://riverbenddentalcare.com/treatments                </p>
