                    The reason PCBs are called single-sided is because the simplest PCBs have parts on one side and wires on the other. This is because the wires only appear on one side. Multilayer boards with multiple layers of conductors require proper circuit connections between the two layers. The bridge between the chains is called a viaduct. The basic PCB design process of FS technology can be divided into four steps:https://fspcba.seesaa.net/article/488741669.html?1654666426(1) FS Technology Schematic Design: Schematic design mainly uses Protel DXP schematic editor for circuit design.Circuit Board Manufacturing and Assembly(2) Network report generation: An online report is a report showing the circuit principle and connection relationship between different components. Bridging and connecting circuit boards and circuit board designs. With the help of the schematic network report, you can quickly find the connection between components, which is convenient for subsequent PCB design.https://pcba.kyo2.jp/e572001.html(3) FS Technology PCB Design: PCB design is what we usually call PCB design. This is the final converted form of the circuit diagram. The corresponding design of this part is more complicated than the schematic design. The powerful design features of Protel DXP can complement this part of the design.(4) Generate FS Technology PCB report: After the PCB design is completed, it is necessary to generate various reports such as output report, PCB information report, network status report, etc., and finally print the PCB layout.1. PCB classification of FS TechnologyPCBs are divided into three categories: single-sided, double-sided and multi-layer printed circuit boards according to the number of layers.1. Single-sided, the simplest PCB, the parts are concentrated on one side and the wires are concentrated on the other side. This type of PCB is called single-sided because the wires only appear on one side. Single panels are generally easy to manufacture and inexpensive, but they have the disadvantage that they cannot be used for overly complex products.https://pcbassembly.tamaliver.jp/e489778.html2. Both sides are extensions of one side. If single-layer wiring is not what your electronics require, use both sides. There are copper pours and traces on both sides, allowing the wires between the two layers to pass through vias to form the desired net connections.3. FS technology multilayer board is a printed circuit board in which three or more layers of conductive patterns and insulating materials are separated by lamination and connected to each other as needed. Multilayer circuit is the product of the development of electronic information technology in the direction of high speed, multi-function, large capacity, small capacity, thinner and lighter.Printed circuit boards are divided into flexible boards (FPC), rigid boards (PCB) and rigid flexible boards (FPCB) according to their characteristics.2. FS Technology's PCB inspection method1. Nadella bed test methodThe method includes connecting a source loading probe to each detection point on a printed circuit board. Is the pressure of each probe 100 connected to the spring? -? These. 200 g? To ensure good contact at each detection point, this connected probe is called a "bed of needles". Under the control of the test software, breakpoints and test signals can be programmed, and the inspector can receive information about all breakpoints.https://pcba.tamaliver.jp/e489780.html2. FS Technology PCB observationDue to the small size and complex structure of the PCB, special observation equipment is also required to observe the PCB. Typically, portable video microscopes are used to observe the structure of printed circuit boards. Using the video microscope camera, you can clearly see the microscopic structure of the microscope circuit board. This simplifies FS Technologies PCB design and testing.3. Dual-probe flying probe test methodThe flying probe is independent of the pin pattern attached to the fixture or stand. Based on this system, two or more probes are attached to a small head that can move freely in the x-y plane, the reference point is CADI? Directly controlled by Gerber data. Dual probes can move within 4 miles of each other. The probes can move independently of each other, and there is no limit to the distance between them. The tester with two arms that can move back and forth is based on capacitance measurements. Press the PCB firmly against the metal plate insulator, which acts as the capacitor's other metal plate. When there is a short between lines, the capacitance will be greater than the capacitance at a particular point.https://www.atoallinks.com/2022/optical-fiducial-pcb-design-fs-technology/                </p>
