                    Reliable supply chains have enabled companies to focus on core activities, allowing customers to enjoy the benefits of specialization. The flip side of complex supply chains is the lack of/limited control on partner practices and the direct impact on a company. Many of us vividly remember the price automakers had to pay due to quality issues in Takata’s airbags; inspections mandated after Kobe admitted to supplying poor quality steel, and Mattel’s toy recall due to excess quantities of lead.                </p>
