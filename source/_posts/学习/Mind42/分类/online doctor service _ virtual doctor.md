                    Online health care services are gaining popularity as more and more doctors are accustoming themselves to using telemedicine. Not to mention the convenience it has provided to individuals who seek medical care for everyday problems, those who live in remote and rural areas who may not have access to a medical facility and the benefit it has for older patients with chronic conditions like diabetes, blood pressure and heart disease.Online doctor services have made it easier for patients and doctors to connect, and quicker too. Life has become too busy for most people to squeeze in a doctor’s appointment, especially for basic and minor heath concerns like the seasonal flu, headache and sinusitis. Online doctor mobile apps have made it easier for people to look up specialists, book online appointments within minutes, consult online and get treated on the go!                </p>
