                    antiwork movieThe pandemic has brought the #antiwork movement into sharper focus, with many workers being branded “essential”, while still not being paid a living wage, and home working challenging the need for a two hour commute.The anti-work movement challenges the notion that hard work at something you don’t enjoy is noble or worth, and challenges society to find ways to value fulfilment, satisfaction and happiness over productivity.This film tells the stories of the individuals that are challenging the status quo, and trying to build a more balanced, happy and peaceful world for us all.https://antiworkmovie.com                </p>
