                    Imagine using your Smartphone to control an interactive art piece on the facade of your high rise building or stepping outside your modern downtown office after a day’s work to watch the game with the whole building in front of you turned into the screen. This and much more is possible with Halo Smart Systems Micro-LED Transparent Glass.                </p>
