                    San Diego mental health impacts all aspects of our life, and self-care is any activity we do deliberately to take care of our mental, emotional, and physical health. Although it’s often overlooked, self-care is an important part of our lives. By nurturing ourselves, we can reduce stress, increase our energy levels, and improve our overall wellbeing.                </p>
