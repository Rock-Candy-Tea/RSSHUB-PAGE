                    How to set up Mywifiext as an Access Point Mode? Now you can configure the newborn Netgear WIFI range extenders to work as an Access Point mode also. The profit out of this setup is that you get the authority to expand your WIFI connection via this range extender by connecting it to your router. You can also extend your WIFI range out of your router. Switch through a cable that enables a loss of minimal performance. It also resolves the issue of dropping connections.                </p>
