                    Organic tea is becoming more and more popular with tea customers, as this cultivation method completely dispenses with the use of agrochemicals. Ecological cultivation protects people and the environment and produces significantly less CO2 than conventional agriculture. Organic soils also store significantly more CO2 and help reduce greenhouse gases.                </p>
