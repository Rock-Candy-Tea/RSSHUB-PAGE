                    Financial analysis to analyze the credit quality of the borrower is an important part of the credit decision-making process. We frequently place greater emphasis on ratios, balance sheets, and profit and loss accounts when performing financial analysis, but it is equally crucial to properly analyze and comprehend the audit report. The audit reports listed below can be analyzed depending on the type of borrower:•         We can request a statutory audit report if the borrower is a corporation (Mandatory for every company).•         A tax audit report is necessary for individuals, LLPs, corporations, and partnerships (If applicable).•         If the borrower is a limited liability partnership (LLP), we can request an audit report under the LLP Act (If applicable).https://stopforeclosurefraud.com/2021/11/24/mortgage-audits-online-has-good-reviews/                </p>
