                    Vfx studios in Delhi ncr: Visual effects (VFX) is the process by which images are altered, created, or enhanced for live action material that cannot be captured during live filming because it is expensive, dangerous, impractical or unable to rotate. Visual effects allow the integration of live action sequences and VFX to create realistic objects, characters and environments. Visual effects (VFX) are images that are created, modified, or enhanced for any film or other moving medium that does not take place during live-action shooting. VFX frequently include combining actual footage with modified graphics to create realistic-looking settings for the context. These locations are either too unsafe to shoot in or worlds that do not exist. They accomplish this through the use of computer-generated imagery (CGI) and specific VFX tools. VFX producers collaborate with directors and cinematographers to determine whether scenes necessitate the use of green screens. https://wcapoststudio.com/vfx/                </p>
