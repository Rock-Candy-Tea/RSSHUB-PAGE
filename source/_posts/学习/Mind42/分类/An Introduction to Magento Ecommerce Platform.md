                    "Magento was first introduced in 2008 and has evolved to become today's most successful e-commerce site. It has a free Community Edition (CE) and an Enterprise Edition (EE). Multiple ""front shops"" are integrated directly into the website, which can be moved between by the client. Multi-language, multi-currency, tax, and VAT support is a regular component of the framework. Magento itself is an open-source platform that allows external inspection into the source. It can run several websites outside, all controlled from the same administration interface.Magento was designed to be expanded due to the flexible modular architecture at its core. A lot of Magento's core features are module extensions developed by the Magento team themselves. This provides an astonishing degree of customization, also enabling the main features to be changed. This level of extensibility and customization separates Magento from other websites for e-commerce. To function well, Magento needs a good hosting server; this is a consequence of the rich and expandable feature architecture."                </p>
