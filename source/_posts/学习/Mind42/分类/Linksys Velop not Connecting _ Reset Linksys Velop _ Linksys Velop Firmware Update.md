                    If your Linksys can handle 50 devices at a time, but you’ve overloaded it with the connectivity of a lot more, you’re going to have an inconsistent internet problem. Log in to your Linksys and see how many devices are linked to it in this situation. If you discover that some of your Linksys’ devices can be disconnected from the network, do the same. This will allow your Linksys to breathe more freely, resulting in improved performance.                </p>
