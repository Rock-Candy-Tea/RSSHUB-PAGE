                    Soccer is an excellent sport for staying in shape, building strength and endurance. Soccer (also known as football in some countries) is the most popular sport in the world, with players from almost every country participating. It's a team sport in which 11 players on each side pass the ball and use their legs, heads, and limbs to score goals. Participants may sprint, run fast or leisurely and occasionally stand around due to the nature of the game.                </p>
