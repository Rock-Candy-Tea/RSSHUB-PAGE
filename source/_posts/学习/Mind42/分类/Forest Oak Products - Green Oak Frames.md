Based in rural Shropshire, we work throughout the UK on a variety of projects from large oak extensions and full builds, to oak porches and pergolas.  We help create bbq spaces, porches, pergolas, garden rooms and extensions..if it's oak we make it! Through relationships grown over four generations with some of the largest oak sawmills across Europe, we are able to buy, cut and deliver high-quality oak frames at competitive trade prices. We provide the design, manufacture and if required, erection of high-quality green oak frames; which we sell to the trade, public, and self-builders.The Manufacturing Yard G Aisle Industrial Estate, Wem, Shrewsbury,  SY4 5SD01939 238 007http://www.forestoak.co.uk                </p>
