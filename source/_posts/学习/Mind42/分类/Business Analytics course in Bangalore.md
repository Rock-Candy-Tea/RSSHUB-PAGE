                    Business Analytics is a data-driven approach to decision-making and problem-solving. This field of study combines data, information technology, statistical analysis, quantitative methods, and computer-based models into one to provide decision-makers with all the possible scenarios to make a well-thought-out and researched decision. The computer-based model ensures that decision-makers are able to see the performance of decisions under various scenarios. Thus, business analytics has evolved as a methodology or tool to make a sound commercial decision that impacts the functioning of the whole organization. Business Analysis acts like a pin that holds the business together. Research by McKinsey shows, that organizations that invest in big data yield a six percent average increase in profits, which jumps to nine percent for investments spanning five years.Visit: https://madeacademy.ac.in/business-analytics/                </p>
