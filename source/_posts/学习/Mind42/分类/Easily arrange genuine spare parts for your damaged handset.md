                    Smartphones have become a key necessity of the human race. Perhaps you will not find even a single man or woman who is not using the latest versions of the smartphone. New technologies keep on evolving in the market and the old technology becomes obsolete. In the last few years, technology has made remarkable improvement.

Modern handsets are so powerful (in terms of features) that they can be compared with laptops.                </p>
