                    Fortunately, American Express has its own webpage dedicated to determining the American Express Card Balance on your card. In fact, I recently received an AMEX gift card as well (I think a gift card is a good idea for the right person) and I'll tell you how to get your balance on the card. And, they not only tell you what your American Express Gift Card Balance is ... they tell you everything that you have spent your money on.The question that asks… Can the person who gave you your AMEX gift card see this information as well? Well, if they have written the information on the card before giving you the information, the answer is "yes". So, before you use the gift card that your boss gave you to buy something untoward, remember that they too (if they are of Snooper type!) Can see the information.But Barbara, that probably won't happen to you, so let's forget about it and give you the answer.First, make sure you have your American Express Gift Card and then go to this American Express page. It seems that American Express has many links to Check American Express Gift Card Balance, but this was the best link ever.You will be asked for the information you see in the picture below:As you have already seen, they will also require you to insert a 3-digit security card which you can find on the back side. I am going to Check American Express Gift Card Balance with you right now. Here I am looking for:Barbara, here you should see how much is left, along with all the transactions made on the card. As should be obvious, you are likewise ready to look by date.. As they do with most of their businesses, Amex does their gift cards in a very professional manner.Barbara, I hope this has helped you figure out how to get an Express Gift Card Balance. Hopefully, you have a lot of money left on the card and you can buy a lot of goods.                </p>
