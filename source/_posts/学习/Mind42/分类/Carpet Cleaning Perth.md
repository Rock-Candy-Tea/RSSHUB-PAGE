                    Perth Carpet Cleaning utilizes the “hot water extraction method” or sometimes referred to as “steam cleaning”, even though no steam is utilized. This is the method recommended in the maintenance brochures of ALL the carpet manufacturers. They recommend this method because their own research indicates that the “hot water extraction” method ensures the best results when cleaning your carpet.                </p>
