                    Animal skin preservation has been used for a very long time. Egyptian tombs have been discovered with embalmed animals. Even while embalming employs lifelike poses, it is not regarded as taxidermy. Soothsayers and apothecaries in the Middle Ages displayed primitive taxidermy specimens. Reaumur in France described the first techniques for bird conservation for natural history cabinets in 1748. Our taxidermy is continuing this tradition and wants to world to have the beauty of these gorgeous birds in your vicinity.                </p>
