                    Entries for the Small Event Management Organisation of the Year were judged on a number of aspects including innovation, best practice and sustainability as well as each nominee’s contribution to events and the difficulties encountered in executing them during such a difficult year. A clear strategy will drive the development of content, attendee experience, and engagement. Next, the delivery plan, and subsequent digital platforms and technology if virtual or hybrid, will bring this all to life for your audience.                </p>
