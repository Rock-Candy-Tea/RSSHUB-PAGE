                    Along with the development of the medical material industry, the sex doll industry is also developing manufacturing technology day and night. Our business policy is not only to meet the needs of customers, but also to stand in the customer's position, always thinking about what kind of thick sex dolls details customers pay attention to. Here, I want to analyze how to choose the material of the love doll.The current mainstream real doll materials are "silicon" and "TPE (elastomer)". Or there is a product called a hybrid sex doll that combines "silicone head + TPE body".WM DollSilicone Sex DollThe application field of silicon material technology is very wide, especially in orthopedic surgery, it is used as breast enhancement material. Therefore, soft and realistic textures are applied in the love doll field. It is characterized by good plasticity of the fuselage (the reproduction rate of the mold), beautiful curves, fine details, and a more realistic sex doll curvy overall look and feel. Compared with TPE material, silicone has better thermal insulation and electrical conductivity, more hygienic and easier to sterilize. Since it contains almost no allergenic ingredients, the human body is less likely to cause an allergic reaction upon contact. The disadvantage is that the material cost is high, the hand feel is harder than TPE, and the damage is less, but it is easy to oxidize and deteriorate. The skin texture of the silicone Xycolo sex dolls is more delicate than TPE, and the appearance looks realistic. By applying makeup after manufacture, the appearance of the silicone sex dolls become more three-dimensional and the shadow on the face becomes more intense.TPE Love DollThe properties of TPE material sex dolls are cheaper than silicone love doll's and soft to the touch. Most manufacturers use TPE material due to its excellent properties. The smooth and soft TPE material is elastic and feels closer to the human body than silicone. When used, it is more effective to use a lubricant. The disadvantage of sex doll is that there is an odor (oil oozing), and the intensity of the odor varies depending on the quality. Due to the low density of the TPE material, it may be scratched or dented when pressed by a sharp or hard object. Also, since TPE material Cosdoll sex doll is softer than silicone love doll, it is more durable and prone to deterioration due to expansion and contraction. That is, the material has a short service life, oil penetration, glossy surface, and lower heat resistance than silicon, and long-term compression may increase plastic deformation.However, full body silicone sex dolls are expensive, so if you want a more realistic tpe love doll within a reasonable budget, we recommend hybrid sex dolls with a custom silicone head + TPE body combination, which can give you the best of both worlds.                </p>
