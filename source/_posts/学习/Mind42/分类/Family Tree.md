                    The word “FAMILY” plays a vital role in every human life because family comes as a top priority; we are well aware of that. Like a tree has its root, stem, branches, leaf, flowers, the same as the family tree has its structure like grandparents, parents, child, and it keeps continuing from generation to generation. “Family tree,” yeah, just two simple words, but these two words are highly important for everyone’s life.                </p>
