                    Biological systems are often represented as networks which are complex sets of binary interactions or relations between different entities. Essentially, every biological entity has interactions with other biological entities, from the molecular to the ecosystem level, providing us with the opportunity to model biology using many different types of networks such as ecological, neurological, metabolic or molecular interaction networks.Biological Network Analysishttps://www.computabio.com/network-analysis-service-in-biology.html                </p>
