                    The Linksys velop app may malfunction due to several reasons. These may range from device-related issues to internal app issues. Nevertheless, here are some ways you can resolve Linksys Velop issues effectively:RESTART YOUR VELOP ROUTERThe very first step in resolving any issue that you face is restarting the router. This will not only clear the bugs but also eliminate any issues with the device firmware configuration. You can also power cycle other peripheral devices so the system memory is cleared up.Switch off your router and allow it to remain in this state for about 20 seconds. After this duration, switch on the devices in a reverse sequence. This will help reboot the device and you’ll be good to go.CHECK FOR VELOP APP UPDATESYou may also face issues with the Velop app due to outdated app versions. Your Linksys app might be running on outdated app versions. Therefore, it becomes important to update the same to the latest version. You can do this by visiting the Linksys website or your device’s respective app store or Google Play Store. When you are on the app page of the website/ or app store, you can simply click on the Download button and then wait for the app to install on your device. Once the installation process is over, restart your smartphone once. This is to clear the temporary files on your system, so you can fix the error that you were running into often.USING INCORRECT LOGIN CREDENTIALSIf you are trying to log in to the Linksys smart wifi app using the credentials that belong to your wireless router, you will get an error. When you are looking to access the Velop app, you’ll need to set a different password. This password can then be used to access the app anytime you decide to configure the features or change the settings.The next time you try to log in, make sure you are using the correct login credentials. The product label on the rear or the bottom of the device contains the admin details. You can find the same on the product manual as well. Refer to the same for details.                </p>
