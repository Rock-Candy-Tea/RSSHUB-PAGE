                    The trouble with a task list is that frequently there are hundreeds of tasks and it's extremely difficult to manage them. Set up can be considered as a bunch of task lists for each and every day. You can schedule all tasks as well as events on precise days as well as forget them till that day comes. Concentrate on today's tasks just as well as keep your waiting list (stockpile) clean.Several tools display tasks in schedule view, nevertheless couple of people use it, since it's misleading. It doesn't show you schedule, it reveals your deadlines. The tasks are revealed based upon due date, which is completely wrong. Time blocks are mosting likely to fix this. You can set up time block on 5th May 2021, while task's due date still is 10th May 2021. In addition to that you can create several time blocks for each task if it calls for greater than 1 day.It's mosting likely to be the first tool which shows you all the tasks as well as events on one screen. Some existing devices sustain events, nonetheless you have to go to Calendar in order to create as well as see them. Our tool allows you to create and see both events as well as tasks on one board. You do not need to switch in between task list and calendar no more.                </p>
