                    The majority of hair extension companies gather hair from different donors and therefore it is not advisable to go with it because it contains hairs that are going in all different directions, which will get tangled and matted. Ottawa Hair Extensions collect 100% hair from a single donor. Thus zero tangling and matting.                </p>
