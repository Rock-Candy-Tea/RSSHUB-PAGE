                    Sightseeing Tours OxfordOur sightseeing river tours, boat trips and private hire cruises take in stunning scenery on the River Thames in and around Oxford. Many of our sightseeing tours cruise along the famous University Regatta course from Folly Bridge but public boat trips are also available to stunning Port Meadow on the northern outskirts of the city. Our private boat hire options allow you to tour the river at your own pace and escape from the busy areas of Oxford, so popular for tours and sightseeing. When booking your cruise with us you will also benefit from our intimate knowledge of Oxford. We can recommend excellent riverside Oxford Restaurants and visits to ancient Inns. Our moorings for our boat trips and tours are a stone's throw from majestic Christ Church College from where you can explore the best of collegiate Oxford.http://www.oxfordrivercruises.com                </p>
