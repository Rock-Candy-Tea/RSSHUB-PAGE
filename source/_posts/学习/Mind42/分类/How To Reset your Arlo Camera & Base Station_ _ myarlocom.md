                    If your Arlo camera is not working as per your requirements, then you will have to perform a factory reset, which will make base station settings go to its default settings and removes the serial number of the Arlo camera from the Arlo account.Here is how to factory reset Base Station:On the back of Arlo Base Station, the reset button is present, so press and hold it using a pointed object for around 7-10 seconds.As you press the reset button, the front LEDs will flash amber light. As the light stops flashing the Amber light, Arlo Base Station reboots and will be reset to default settings. Resetting Base station will also remove it from the Arlo account.Now, perform Netgear sign in using the Arlo app or web browser, but only after you see the green light flashing on power and internet LEDs.                </p>
