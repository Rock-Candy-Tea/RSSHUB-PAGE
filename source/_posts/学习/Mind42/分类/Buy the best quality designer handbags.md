                    Don't we all have a go-to all-weather bag that we can rely on? This is the one that we carry around with us on a daily basis, regardless of whether it is summer, winter, or springtime. Perhaps it has become tattered and a touch too well-worn in recent months. Maybe it's time to give your handbag collections a facelift now that we're well into fall and heading into winter. Every high-end designer accessories company, as well as some more budget ones, appears to agree, as seen by the plethora of new handbag designs that have hit the runways and our Instagram posts this summer.                </p>
