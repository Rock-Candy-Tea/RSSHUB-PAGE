                    The status of the live stream from your Arlo camera can be affected by Wi-Fi or internet connectivity issues. This does not affect the video recordings that are saved in your Arlo Library. Because 4K streaming uses more network resources than lower resolution video, you might notice that the live stream turns completely green, purple, or gray when you’re using multiple 4K live streams at the same time.                </p>
