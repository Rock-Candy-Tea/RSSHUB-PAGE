                    As an experienced New Jersey Bankruptcy Lawyer or NJ Bankruptcy Attorney, I understand that financial problems like Debt Consolidation NJ can happen to good families who work hard, and I am dedicated to helping people save their homes and get back on their feet by offering solutions in Chapter 7 NJ :Liquidation Bankruptcy For Consumers and Businesses and Chapter 13 NJ :Reorganization or Repayment Bankruptcy For Consumers , not just a “quick fix.” I have successfully represented individual and commercial clients in bankruptcy proceedings for over twenty-five years. I offer full-service bankruptcy representation at reasonable fees.                </p>
