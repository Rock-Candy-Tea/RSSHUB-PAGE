                    Eatlocal deliver boxes of fantastic quality fruit and veges to healthy homes across New Zealand, and have been around for two years now, working with local Kiwi family farmers and growers, and artisan food producers.Joanne Webb, who heads up the Christchurch-based operation, is passionate about bringing you the best, freshest quality produce available, right to your door.  No supermarket “squeezed” or rubbery veges here!  It comes from the producer direct to your door in super-quick time.A little background on Joanne.  With a past career as a self-employed beauty therapist, she has always believed unrivalled customer service to be absolutely paramount, and continues this ethos into her work today. A few years ago, she took up running, purely because she was told she would “never be able to run a marathon”, The challenge was duly accepted and she has now completed the 42.2km distance several times.  She therefore understands the importance of a balanced, varied diet filled with fresh, good quality food to nourish and fuel the body in order to get the best out of it.https://www.eatlocal.nz/                </p>
