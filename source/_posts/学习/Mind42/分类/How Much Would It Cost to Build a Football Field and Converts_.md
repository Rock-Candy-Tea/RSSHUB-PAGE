                    The kicking game is perhaps one of the most under-appreciated aspects of the game that we as football coaches overlook. people tend to put the kicking game on the back burner until the last practice, line them up, kick a half-dozen or more field goals and point after, and then send the guys home as we prepare to play an opponent and prepare our football systems.                </p>
