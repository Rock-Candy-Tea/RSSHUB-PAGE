                    At Critter Stop, we help customers in the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex dealing with critters – primarily mice, rats, squirrels, opossums, skunks, and raccoons, usually in their attic. We find and seal all potential entry points around the home or commercial building that even a mouse could get into, trap and / or remove any animals currently in the building, and once we are confident we got the animals out, sanitize the attic.                </p>
