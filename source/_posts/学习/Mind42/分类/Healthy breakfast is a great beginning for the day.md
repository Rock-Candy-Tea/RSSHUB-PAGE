                    Breakfast is the most important meal of the day. It is the first meal of the new day so you must take it in a good mood. Some people eat light breakfast, which is incorrect. You must eat a heavy and healthy breakfast if necessary. Some people eat only when they are hungry. The decision regards the morning meal as very important because it gives energy to the entire body. Those who neglect breakfast are at the risk of obesity. It is good to consult a dietician because he or she will give you valuable guidance. https://henrycooper0013.blogspot.com/2022/04/healthy-breakfast-is-great-beginning.html                </p>
