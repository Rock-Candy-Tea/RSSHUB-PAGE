                    After deciding that the pre-existing Pack-n-Ship business was not our cup of tea, we had to figure out what to do with this historic 1912 brick building located in downtown Brighton. Months of restoring the brick building to its original beauty left us with a beautiful blank slate.Still not knowing what to do and needing a tenant, we passed an old favorite haunt, Sweet Tomato, in Lafayette. The sign said “The Tomato is Back!” Excited, we went to eat there the next day; it was as if they had never skipped a beat even after being closed for five years. We kept going back and finally met the owner, Annie Vick. Sensing an opportunity, we told her about our building in hopes that she would be interested in bringing her ideas and recipes to Brighton.Before we knew it, we were partners in Brighton’s newest Italian restaurant, Pinocchio’s. It has truly been an alignment of the stars; this restaurant was made for this building and made for this town.Since opening in February 2009, we have established ourselves in Brighton’s community with our consistently high quality Italian food, service, and ambiance. We were in business with Annie and Rod Vick until April 2010, when they felt we were “ready to leave the nest,” so to speak. We have maintained a wonderful working and personal relationship with the Vicks.We are amazed day after day when speaking with our guests, always hearing, “What an incredible meal! What an incredible place!” We promise you: simply incredible Italian. Join us for lunch or dinner today, and remember us for all of your catering and private dining needs. https://www.pinocchiosbrighton.com                </p>
