                    Mostafa Azimitabar is a Kurdish-Iranian refugee who was detained by the Australian Government in Australia’s Immigration. He fled from his homeland in the year 2013 by boat. Later arrived on Christmas Island the same year in the month of July. It all started when Moz felt himself in danger while living in his own homeland. However, unfortunately, the decision he made to take refuge from Iran to Australia did not happen to be in his favor. He was then imprisoned on Christmas Island with more than 60 innocent people.The journey then continues from the Island to a Melbourne Motel. This way he along with all the other refugee had to spend 8 years imprisoned illegally. Mostafa Azimitabar called life in the hotels the “Luxury Torcher Cell”.                </p>
