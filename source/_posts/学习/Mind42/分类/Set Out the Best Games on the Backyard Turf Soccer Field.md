                    For backyard recreation, artificial turf is an ideal playing surface. It needs minimal upkeep and does not show wear and tear. Without affecting the playing surface, it can be changed repeatedly. On a backyard turf soccer field, you can play badminton, volleyball, flag football, and many others without damaging the grass or creating a mess when it comes to its effective clean-up.                </p>
