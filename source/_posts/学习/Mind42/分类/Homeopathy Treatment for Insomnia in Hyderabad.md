                    Traveling long distances on a regular basis, frequent changes in working hours or shifts, ageing, pregnancy, and menopause are all high-risk factors for insomnia. Insomnia refers to difficulty staying asleep, hard to fall asleep, or cause you to wake up too early. It can sap your mood and energy level and health and performance at work.
