                    Transportation of a vehicle from one place to the other is a risky affair. There is road debris that can leave scratches and nicks in the paint and wheel, or the transmission can also be damaged if you are using another car for dragging the vehicle. It is where the services of flatbed towing Calgary and others are involved.                </p>
