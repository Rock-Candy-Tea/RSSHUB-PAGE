                    Elementary schools are also called grade or grammar Schools. Grammar Schools work hard to ensure there is interest in all students for their subjects. With a kind and friendly teacher to make learning fun, children take an interest in learning and develop good learning habits. Young minds are encouraged to think and understand.                </p>
