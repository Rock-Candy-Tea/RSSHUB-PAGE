                    It can be hard for tweens to handle a big project because they have to figure out how to manage their time and research and write, as well as pick a topic that they have never done before. It’s important for your child to learn these skills, but you can cheer her on and give her advice while still letting her work on her own. As a parent, you can help your child if she gets stuck on one of the steps.                </p>
