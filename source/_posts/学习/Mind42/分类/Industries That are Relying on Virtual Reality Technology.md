                    Virtual reality was first presented through science fiction, in which people could interact with virtual surroundings for education, enjoyment, and entertainment. This technology can transport your mind in those areas and situations which aren't real. Virtual reality experiences aren't that common today, but you may experience them almost everywhere in the future....                </p>
