                    At Fundamental Engineering PLLC we are responsible for providing several types of services in the field of structural design and architecture. One of the most common service requests we receive from our esteemed customers in Texas is to design a cost-effective retaining wall efficiently. Retaining walls are a common sight in Texas. Truth be told, a retaining wall is a common solution we have to provide when carrying out the home repair in San Antonio, Elgin, etc. But seldom do we come across customers who are fully aware of how many benefits are retaining walls can be of in their homes.                </p>
