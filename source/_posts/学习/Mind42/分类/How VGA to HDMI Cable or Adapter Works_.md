                    VGA and HDMI are both interface standards that are used for connections that link various devices to displays such as televisions, computer monitors, and projectors. Examples of such devices include laptop computers as well as DVD players. The Video Graphics Array (VGA) is an obsolete standard that transmits just a video stream. Newer electronic gadgets, including such Blu-Ray players or LED TVs, typically come equipped with HDMI as the cable of choice by default. The High-Definition Multimedia Interface (HDMI) can transmit both digital video and audio signals, and it can also secure the data using HDCP.                </p>
