                    Service all beer fittings in cellar and replaced all perished O-Rings — One of the main causes of beer wastage and poor beer quality is cellar equipment that has beer poorly maintained. We found a large number of couplers, snap-lock fittings and adapters had been, or were leaking. We service all fittings and replaced O-Rings.Installed new fob bleeder O-Rings — We found all fob bleeders were stiff and had nicks in the O-Rings which would cause beer to be lost down the drain. Potential for a complete keg on every fob.                </p>
