                    Not only can one receive a Reiki treatment but they can also become a channel for the Reiki energy through a process called an attunement. The attunement also sparks a 21 day energetic cleansing period where deep healing and transformation is often experienced. Anyone who is interested has the ability to harness and utilize this energy for the good of all.
