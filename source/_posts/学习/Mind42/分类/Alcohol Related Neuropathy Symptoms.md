                    Alcoholic Neuropathy is a disorder that causes the nerves in our bodies to malfunction. When this condition affects multiple nerves, it is called Polyneuropathy. When it affects only one nerve it is called Mononeuropathy. When Neuropathy progresses to this stage, the neural signals between body parts and the brain disconnect, leading to skin, muscle, and organ dysfunctions. The disease can go on, even when the person affected has stopped drinking alcohol. Feel free to call us to speak with one of our counselors, we can inform you about this condition by giving you relevant information.                </p>
