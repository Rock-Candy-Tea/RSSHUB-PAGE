                    Dental crowns are long-lasting and durable tooth prosthetics. Indianapolis dental crown specialists Dr. Ben Ahlbrecht ensure that their patients are happy and comfortable with their crowns. Modern porcelain crowns are beautiful, life-like, blend in with the other teeth and are nearly indestructible. Unlike cosmetic dental treatments, crowns are usually included in dental plan coverage.https://www.newyork-cosmeticdentist.com/what-we-offer/bridges/                </p>
