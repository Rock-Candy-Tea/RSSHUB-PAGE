                    Smart House Solar is a one-stop shop for solar panels in Queensland, from selling panels and inverters to setting you up with a CEC-accredited, licensed solar panel installer. They’ll also do everything in between, answering any questions that crop up through their team of solar experts. Their residential solar options include a variety of options when it comes to total power output – 5.5kW, 6.6kW, and 10kW. This caters to a range of household sizes. When it comes to commercial solar, there are three options that offer powerful output for larger buildings – 20kW, 30kW, and 50kW.                </p>
