                    Because soccer is the most popular team ball sport globally, one may imagine that all of the sport's rules and regulations would have been created, understood from the start or at the very least that some widely accepted and applied rules would exist. This is somewhat accurate because we all comprehend the same thing when it comes to phrases like out, goal kick, foul, and so on.                </p>
