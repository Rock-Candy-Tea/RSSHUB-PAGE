                    he popularity of these kinds of tats is due to several factors. First, the imagery of the feminine is one of its most important features. Second, since the concept of purity is very delicate in nature, the underboob tattoo is a wonderful symbolic representation of it. Third, such tats tend to be perfect places for detailed lines and shading since the artist has more freedom with them. Most women want their tattoos to be both beautiful and functional at the same time. Such an endeavor becomes easier when the tattoo is done on a delicate underboob region.                </p>
