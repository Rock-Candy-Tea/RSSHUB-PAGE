                    Garage doors are big, and generally quite sturdy, given the type of function expected from them. Garage doors may be opened and closed multiple times a day, and they have to function well despite huge variations in temperatures. They have to be able to withstand anything and everything from snow, pouring rain, extreme heat, and so much more. Sometimes they might get dents, scratches or other damage. Despite how roughly they are used, they generally last a long time before needing replacement.                </p>
