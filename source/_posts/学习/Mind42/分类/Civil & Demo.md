                    Concerned about a demolition business cleaning a site but leaving it in a shambles? At Civil and Demo, we always leave your site clean and levelled out since we recognise that no one enjoys cleaning up after someone else has left. When we're through with a job, we take care of the garbage collection so you don't have to bother about paying someone else to clean up afterwards. Civil and Demo offers partial excavations for structures and sites, as well as the removal of certain rooms or walls. This means you may add additional expansions and modify portions of your building to your taste without destroying everything.                </p>
