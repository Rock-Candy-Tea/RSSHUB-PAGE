                    How food waste impacts on environmental sustainability. The primary goal of this inquiry is to investigate and gain a deeper understanding of how food waste affects the environment and threatens sustainability.  I have defined the parameters of this inquiry to finding relevant and unbiased research on food waste in Australia.                </p>
