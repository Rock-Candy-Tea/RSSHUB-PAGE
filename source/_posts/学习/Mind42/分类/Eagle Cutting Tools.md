                    The Eagle Eye series of end mills and Eagle cutting tools are used to cut materials with a hardness of between HRC 45 and HRC 55. The same material is also used to make "Miniature End Mills." This high-tech line is used for many different things and has a special ultrafine carbide grade for HSC machining.                </p>
