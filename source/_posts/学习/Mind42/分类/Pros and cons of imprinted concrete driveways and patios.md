                    There is the new kid in the block namely the imprinted or stamped concrete paving of driveways and porticos. Paving portico with blocks or bricks is no new practice but imprinted concrete pavements, driveways and curbs are new and this new technology is immensely strong and has the ability to survive for several decades. You can consult Driveway and Patio Contractors Oxfordshire to know more about this new way of forming driveways. Imprinted concrete driveways are better looking and better performing than the traditional blocks or bricks pavements and we will discuss the pros and cons of the imprinted concrete driveways here:     https://justpaste.it/74rve                </p>
