                    Exodus 34:29-35 (NRSVA)The Shining Face of Moses29 Moses came down from Mount Sinai. As he came down from the mountain with the two tablets of the covenant[a] in his hand, Moses did not know that the skin of his face shone because he had been talking with God. 30 When Aaron and all the Israelites saw Moses, the skin of his face was shining, and they were afraid to come near him. 31 But Moses called to them; and Aaron and all the leaders of the congregation returned to him, and Moses spoke with them. 32 Afterwards all the Israelites came near, and he gave them in commandment all that the Lord had spoken with him on Mount Sinai. 33 When Moses had finished speaking with them, he put a veil on his face; 34 but whenever Moses went in before the Lord to speak with him, he would take the veil off, until he came out; and when he came out, and told the Israelites what he had been commanded, 35 the Israelites would see the face of Moses, that the skin of his face was shining; and Moses would put the veil on his face again, until he went in to speak with him.Footnotes:Exodus 34:29 Or treaty, or testimony; Heb eduthPsalm 99 (NRSVA)Praise to God for His Holiness1 The Lord is king; let the peoples tremble!    He sits enthroned upon the cherubim; let the earth quake!2 The Lord is great in Zion;    he is exalted over all the peoples.3 Let them praise your great and awesome name.    Holy is he!4 Mighty King,[a] lover of justice,    you have established equity;you have executed justice    and righteousness in Jacob.5 Extol the Lord our God;    worship at his footstool.    Holy is he!6 Moses and Aaron were among his priests,    Samuel also was among those who called on his name.    They cried to the Lord, and he answered them.7 He spoke to them in the pillar of cloud;    they kept his decrees,    and the statutes that he gave them.8 O Lord our God, you answered them;    you were a forgiving God to them,    but an avenger of their wrongdoings.9 Extol the Lord our God,    and worship at his holy mountain;    for the Lord our God is holy.Footnotes:Psalm 99:4 Cn: Heb And a king’s strength2 Corinthians 3:12-4:2 (NRSVA)12 Since, then, we have such a hope, we act with great boldness, 13 not like Moses, who put a veil over his face to keep the people of Israel from gazing at the end of the glory that[a] was being set aside. 14 But their minds were hardened. Indeed, to this very day, when they hear the reading of the old covenant, that same veil is still there, since only in Christ is it set aside. 15 Indeed, to this very day whenever Moses is read, a veil lies over their minds; 16 but when one turns to the Lord, the veil is removed. 17 Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom. 18 And all of us, with unveiled faces, seeing the glory of the Lord as though reflected in a mirror, are being transformed into the same image from one degree of glory to another; for this comes from the Lord, the Spirit.Treasure in Clay Jars4 Therefore, since it is by God’s mercy that we are engaged in this ministry, we do not lose heart. 2 We have renounced the shameful things that one hides; we refuse to practise cunning or to falsify God’s word; but by the open statement of the truth we commend ourselves to the conscience of everyone in the sight of God.Footnotes:2 Corinthians 3:13 Gk of whatLuke 9:28-43 (NRSVA)The Transfiguration28 Now about eight days after these sayings Jesus[a] took with him Peter and John and James, and went up on the mountain to pray. 29 And while he was praying, the appearance of his face changed, and his clothes became dazzling white. 30 Suddenly they saw two men, Moses and Elijah, talking to him. 31 They appeared in glory and were speaking of his departure, which he was about to accomplish at Jerusalem. 32 Now Peter and his companions were weighed down with sleep; but since they had stayed awake,[b] they saw his glory and the two men who stood with him. 33 Just as they were leaving him, Peter said to Jesus, ‘Master, it is good for us to be here; let us make three dwellings,[c] one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah’—not knowing what he said. 34 While he was saying this, a cloud came and overshadowed them; and they were terrified as they entered the cloud. 35 Then from the cloud came a voice that said, ‘This is my Son, my Chosen;[d] listen to him!’ 36 When the voice had spoken, Jesus was found alone. And they kept silent and in those days told no one any of the things they had seen.Jesus Heals a Boy with a Demon37 On the next day, when they had come down from the mountain, a great crowd met him. 38 Just then a man from the crowd shouted, ‘Teacher, I beg you to look at my son; he is my only child. 39 Suddenly a spirit seizes him, and all at once he[e] shrieks. It throws him into convulsions until he foams at the mouth; it mauls him and will scarcely leave him. 40 I begged your disciples to cast it out, but they could not.’ 41 Jesus answered, ‘You faithless and perverse generation, how much longer must I be with you and bear with you? Bring your son here.’ 42 While he was coming, the demon dashed him to the ground in convulsions. But Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, healed the boy, and gave him back to his father. 43 And all were astounded at the greatness of God.Footnotes:Luke 9:28 Gk heLuke 9:32 Or but when they were fully awakeLuke 9:33 Or tentsLuke 9:35 Other ancient authorities read my BelovedLuke 9:39 Or it                </p>
