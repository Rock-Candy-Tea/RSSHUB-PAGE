                    Russian bride’s dot com is part of a larger network called Anastasiadate.com or Anastasia international. The thing to understand with all of these mail order bride sites is that. They have to work hard in order to protect both parties. If one party example the Russian women turns out to be a scam artist Anastasia international can be held liable also on the flip side of the coin. If the American male turns out to be a wanted man again Anastasia international could be held liable for damages. Its little details like this that makes these types of sites the way they are. I never recommend going this route unless you have plans to actually meet in this case the Russian mail-order bride in person.                </p>
