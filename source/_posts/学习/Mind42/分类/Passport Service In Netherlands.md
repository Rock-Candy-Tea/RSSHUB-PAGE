                    Netherlands passports are issued to citizens of the Kingdom of the Netherlands (Dutch: Koninkrijk der Nederlanden) for the purpose of international travel. The passport also serves as a means of identification as required by the Netherlands law since 1 January 2005 for all Netherlands citizens. The passport complies with the rules (EU Council Regulation 2252/04) for European Union passports.                </p>
