                    As the time is changing, the trends are also changing. It is an expectation of the United Nations that in the next thirty years, more than three fourths of the world’s population will live in the cities. Now, humanity is forced to find some new ways of living and container houses are the best methods to resolve the living space problem. People look for interconnected urban spaces where they can live freely. It is the time to be creative. You must have seen that now the buildings and other types of residential shelters are being constructed from new types of material and shipping containers are one among them.                </p>
