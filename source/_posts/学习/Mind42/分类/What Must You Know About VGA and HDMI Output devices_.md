                    The acronym HDMI refers to the High-Definition Multimedia Interface, which is a standard that allows for the simultaneous transmission of digital video and audio from a source, including a computer or a TV cable box, to a computer monitor, TV, or projector. HDMI was developed by the High-Definition Content Delivery Group (HDCP). It was first designed by a consortium of electronic manufacturers, but it has since gained widespread use, and virtually all televisions, as well as computer displays, accept the interface now. Utilizing HDMI rather than utilizing other standards results in a variety of beneficial outcomes. The fact that prior standards could only transmit either video or audio provides HDMI a significant advantage over other standards since it enables it to transfer both types of data simultaneously. What is the result? One cable is sufficient for the typical customers who wish to connect their game console to their television or another electronic device of a similar nature and who simply want to do so.                </p>
