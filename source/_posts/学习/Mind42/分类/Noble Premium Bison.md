                    One can prepare patties by combining bison meat, garlic, salt, and fresh rosemary. The patties are divided into four numbers and fried in ghee to produce a tasty burger! The patty is served on a bed of arugula, tomatoes, and a sweet potato mash.The Taco bowl is prepared with beans, ground meat, onions, peppers, taco seasoning, rice, cheese, lettuce, and tomato! Additionally, I need to add onions. The unique taste is got by soaking the bison meat in taco seasoning.There are additional dishes like Macaroni and Cheese with Ground Bison. It is done using ground pasta, onions, peppers, garlic, and tomato sauce. Bison Bolognese is prepared with carrots as a base, celery, and onions. Dry red wine and crushed tomatoes are used with the sauce.                </p>
