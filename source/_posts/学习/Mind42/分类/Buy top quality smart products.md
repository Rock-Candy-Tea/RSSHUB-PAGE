                    Products are being transformed by advances in information technology. Products, which used to be made up only of mechanical and electrical components, have evolved into sophisticated systems that incorporate hardware, sensors, storage systems, microprocessors, programming, and networking in a variety of configurations. Smart, connected devices, made possible by significant advancements in computing power and device downsizing, as well as the network advantages of pervasive wireless networking, have ushered in an era of intense rivalry that has never been seen before.                </p>
