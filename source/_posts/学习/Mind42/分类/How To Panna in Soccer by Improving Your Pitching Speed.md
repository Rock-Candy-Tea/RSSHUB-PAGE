                    On a baseball team, the pitcher is one of the most crucial roles. You will have a losing ball club no matter how well your team hits or scores runs if you don't have a competent pitching staff full of skilled folks. Any baseball club can advance to the next level by having a skilled pitcher who can throw various pitches with good velocity.                </p>
