                    Philadelphia is a dirty city. There's no denying it. We can start cleaning it up at the restaurants. Grease traps can collect a lot of grim; however, it's not something a grease trap cleaning service can't take on. Our service at Philadelphia Grease Trap Cleaning provides what customers need most. A clean and maintained grease trap and grease interceptors. Our trucks are large enough to service both large and small projects. Those who would like to accomplish getting their large system clean will love that we have 20 trucks that are perfectly able to do the job. A 2000 gallon tanker can clear up almost any mess. Consider working with us the next time you need your grease traps and grease interceptors clean.                </p>
