                    We cover all aspects of the family law umbrella including - Care of Children Act (COCA), Adoption, Protection Orders, PPPR applications (property manager/welfare guardian). We can also advise on Estate Litigation. Family law is the area of law that addresses family relationships. It includes creating family relationships and breaking them through divorce and termination of parental rights. This law addresses adoption, contested custody of children, etc. ...
