                    pet portraitsWe're an Australian based team creating beautiful pet portraits.Let’s face it, we founded Snoop & Co because of our boy Snoop. He’s great most of the time (when he’s not being naughty). We’ve developed a huge love for pets, and wanted to share that love with other homes across Australia.After we made a pet portrait ourselves for Snoop, we couldn’t help but love it. And, so did our friends when we gifted them.We quickly realised that other pet lovers and owners deserve our pet portraits too, so that’s why we’ve specialised and perfected our portraits so we can deliver the best product to you.https://snoopandco.com                </p>
