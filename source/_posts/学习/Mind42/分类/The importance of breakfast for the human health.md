                    Understand the science behind the breakfast before taking the meals. According to the health experts, the first meal of the day should be taken with great enthusiasm. You must have heard that the breakfast should be taken like a king and the lunch should be taken like a prince and the dinner should be taken like a pauper. Of course, this is just a saying but many people apply the same formula in their everyday life. This is not just a proverb. The first meal of the day should be sufficient enough to give you a dose of energy. The Charleys subs can satisfy your taste buds.                </p>
