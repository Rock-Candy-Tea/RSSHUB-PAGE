                    All of us know the importance of lunch, breakfast and dinner. Just like a vehicle needs fuel to travel, the human body also needs food. You must take your meals and especially breakfast. If you are skipping meals then this means that you are not serious about your health. There are many people who get up late and as a result they skip their meals. Some people are very lazy and they feel like doing nothing. This type of laziness is bad for your health and you must make special arrangements to take your lunch. You must take your breakfast because it is very necessary for human health.
