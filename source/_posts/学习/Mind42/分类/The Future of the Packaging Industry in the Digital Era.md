                    Suppose we possessed a pair of binoculars that allowed us to see into the future and see what packaging would look like then. From what we have learned so far, it's not hard to come up with an idea. We can obtain a decent idea of what the future of the packaging business could look like by examining new technologies, global packaging trends, and market forecasts. Sustainability, design, manufacturing processes, and more will all be discussed in depth here.                </p>
