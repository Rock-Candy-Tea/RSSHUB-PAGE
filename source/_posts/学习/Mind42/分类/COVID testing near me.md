                    COVID testing tells you if you are infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. There are two types of viral tests: rapid tests and laboratory tests. Viral tests use samples that come from your nose or mouth. Rapid tests can be achieved in minutes and include antigen and some NAATs. There are hospitals for covid testing, but the leading clinic for COVID testing near me is in Wilmington.USA.                </p>
