                    Quickbooks Error 1328 mostly occurs during a configuration process where there is some kind of mismatch. Whenever a user tries to Install, Update, Repair, or even Uninstall the Quickbooks this error can pop-up. However, this error mostly shows up when a user is trying to update the Quickbooks, and most often or not this error is due to the company files found in the “.msi” configured folder, and the file will be in the form “.tmp”.                </p>
