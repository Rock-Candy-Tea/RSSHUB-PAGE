                    It is common knowledge that as we age - we face more health related issues. At the early stage, symptoms can be easily ignored. When all of a sudden - you cannot hear the microwave or your own child's voice. These sometimes subtle, and sometimes large differences compared to early life can make you worry.                </p>
