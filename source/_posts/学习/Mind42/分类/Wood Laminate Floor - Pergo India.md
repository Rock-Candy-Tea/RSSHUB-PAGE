                    Wood Laminate Floor: Laminate floors, also referred to as 'floating floors' because of their particular installation, and are manufactured through a wondrous process that involves fusing of layers at high temperatures of about 300 F. Pergo India  Wood Floors are made for Indian conditions. They offer superior protection against dust, scratches and extreme climatic changes. Pergo India Wood Floors are produced using technology like the Perma Click interlocking system that leaves no gaps in the floor: no gaps mean any dirt in the crevices.                </p>
