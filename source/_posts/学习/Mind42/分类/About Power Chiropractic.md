                    At Power Chiropractic, our approach is significantly different than traditional chiropractic and therapy. We practice Bio-Structural RestorationTM using the Life By Design Chiropractic MethodTM, the purpose of which is to narrow in on a CORE PROBLEM with the spinal column and underlying nervous system. These spinal distortions can be affecting your health in ways you already feel, but more importantly, in ways you could have no idea about.                </p>
