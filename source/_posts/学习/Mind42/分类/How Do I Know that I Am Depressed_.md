                    Being sad is not the same as being depressed. Depression is a term frequently used loosely to describe how we feel when we are gone through a breakup or after a bad week at work. But major depressive disorder, a type of depression, is much more complicated. Major depressive disorder or depression is a state of mind in which a person undergoes a mood disorder involving a constant loss of pleasure or interest in daily life activities. This constant feeling of sadness differs from mood fluctuations that people often experience as a part of their lives.                </p>
