                    Do you need to know how big a football field is? You'll find the answers in our pitch size guide! Football pitches are an essential part of the sport. A mini football pitch dimension can make the difference between winning and losing, or between delight and frustration; it can even differentiate between playing and not playing, depending on where you are in the footballing hierarchy.                </p>
