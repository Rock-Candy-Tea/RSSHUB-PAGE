                    Located atop a granite bluff overlooking Okanagan Lake, our serene location provides a retreat-like experience to help you revitalize and unplug from the world outside our walls. Sparkling Hill Resort was founded by Gernot Langes-Swarovski, patriarch of the Swarovski crystal family, to fulfill the mission of educating and facilitating our guests’ personal journey to whole body wellness and enhancing their overall quality of life.                </p>
