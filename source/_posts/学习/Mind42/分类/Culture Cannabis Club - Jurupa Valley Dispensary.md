                    Culture Cannabis Club’s passion for cannabis is at the core of every team member you encounter while shopping here at our Jurupa Valley branch. We're constantly learning and striving to a level of expertise so that we're prepared to answer any question and help guide you through the best possible experience. Our passion for providing the best weed has evolved into adopting the same philosophy in offering our concentrates and cannabis oils. We want to inspire those who walk through our doors and show you what the world of cannabis has to offer. Whether it's relieving pain, making spirits feel alive, taking yourself to higher ground, or anything you need it for, we want you to share in our love for our handpicked buds.Address: 10810 Limonite Ave, Mira Loma, CA 91752, United StatesTelephone: 951-444-6144Website: http://culturecannabisclub.comBusiness Hours: Mon - Sun: 8:00am - 10:00pm                </p>
