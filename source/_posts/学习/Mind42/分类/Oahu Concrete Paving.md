                    Oahu Concrete Paving is well known throughout the Hawaiian Islands as being one of the top full-service concrete contractors available. We do all construction projects which involve the use of concrete which include concrete placement, concrete curing, forming, excavation, grading, demolition, and we also handle rebar reinforcements. We can build generally any type of structure that involves concrete which may be a pool deck, walkway, patio, driveway, sidewalk, footer, slabs, and more. We have highly skilled finishers that will accurately spread the concrete, and we also handle stamped and sealed concrete jobs as well. We have a total of about 15 years of experience in pouring, forming and finishing concrete projects to any specifications that you may require. We can handle small jobs, large jobs, and anything in between.                </p>
