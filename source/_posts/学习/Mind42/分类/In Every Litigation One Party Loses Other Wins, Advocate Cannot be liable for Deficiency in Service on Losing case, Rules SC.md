                    The Supreme Court has ruled that an advocate losing a case cannot be attributed to a lack of service on his or her part. The bench of Justices MR Shah and BV Nagarathn observed that in every litigation, one of the parties is bound to lose, and in such a situation, either of the parties who will lose in the litigation may approach the consumer courtfor compensation alleging deficiency in service, which is not permissible at all,”                </p>
