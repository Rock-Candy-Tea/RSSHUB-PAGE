                    House of Holiday is the ultimate Christmas shopping destination. Every imaginable decoration, from ornaments and lights to trees and all the trimmings, can be found glistening from our walls and lighting up the aisles of our two floors and 35,000 square feet of space. Located in Ozone Park, New York, we are one of the most coveted holiday stores in the country and offer by far the largest selection of live and artificial Christmas trees. Our dedicated staff members work year-round to ensure that the products we offer are only and always the best, and we consistently provide the kind of service that has earned House of Holiday an annual honorary spot at the top of Santa's Nice List.https://houseofholiday.com                </p>
