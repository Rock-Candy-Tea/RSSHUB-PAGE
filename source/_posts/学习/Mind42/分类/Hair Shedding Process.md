                    On average, we shed around 50 to 100 hairs each day in the natural process. But when wearing extensions for your hair, the shed hair that is supposed to appear through your brush or the shower will remain connected to the extension and won't shed after the hair extension has been removed. Once the extensions have been removed, hair is combed away, and it appears that the hair is falling out simultaneously. It is unnecessary to worry about hair falling out as you remove the hair shedding process because this is just naturally shed.                </p>
