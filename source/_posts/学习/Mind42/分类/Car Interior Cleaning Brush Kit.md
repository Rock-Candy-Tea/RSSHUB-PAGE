                    To guarantee good hygiene and car maintenance, it is vital to regularly clean your car both inside and outside on a regular basis. It is best to use Car Interior Cleaning Brush Kit and dusters to clean every nook and cranny of your car. The telescoping duster's non-slip grip handle makes it easy to dust even the tightest nooks and crannies. The microfiber can also be taken out of the handle and washed in the machine.                </p>
