                    Futsal is a game that is also known as "inside soccer" or "indoor football." That's because the game's rules are the same as soccer's, and it is played indoors. The futsal pitch, or court, on which this game is played, is not the same as that used for soccer. In this article, there are some more great details on the futsal court.                </p>
