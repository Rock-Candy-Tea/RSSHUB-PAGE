                    The transition from Summer into Fall brings beautiful colors, delicious treats (hello PSL!!) and sweater weather, but with that come several important changes for your plants. Some will go into full dormancy, most will greatly slow their rate of growth to conserve energy. https://edsplantshop.com/blogs/info-education/are-you-and-your-plants-ready-for-fall                </p>
