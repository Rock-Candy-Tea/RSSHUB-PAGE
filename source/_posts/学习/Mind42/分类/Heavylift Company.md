This type of job typically requires that you have two people and it is recommended that at least one of you be a very seasoned and experienced auto mechanic. If you change the oil on your crate engine regularly there should be little if any reason to change the oil pump at any regular intervals, typically oil pumps last for many miles before needing to be replaced. If your vehicle is having problems with the oil pressure being low you'll want to make sure you check to see if one of the pickups is clogged or if you have clogged oil runners or bad bearings. If you discover that the problem is centered around the bearings or if for some other reason you need to remove your vehicle's engine at this point you should replace the oil pump whether it is bad or not because you already have the engine out of the vehicle.For More Info:-https://www.heavylift.co.nz/wayco-15-ton-hand-operated-workshop-press.htmlhttps://www.heavylift.co.nz/workshop-equipment/oil-dispensing-equipment/oil-equipment/oil-pumps.html                </p>
