                    Inpatient treatment is a type of addiction treatment where patients reside at a rehabilitation facility 24/7 while receiving supervised and highly structured care for their drug and alcohol addiction.  Once a person enters inpatient drug or alcohol rehabilitation, they become a full-time resident of their chosen program and receive targeted care and support 24 hours a day, seven days a week.                </p>
