                    The location that you install and position your camera at is an important decision. This will ensure that the camera does not record unintended scenes mistakenly. While you are trying to configure the camera settings and install them at a location, make sure you look at things like camera angle and what areas does it cover by logging in using the arlo login page. As an owner of the Arlo camera system, you are in control of the area being monitored and you’re supposed to be comfortable with that. If not, relocate the camera from personal spaces like the master bedroom, etc.                </p>
