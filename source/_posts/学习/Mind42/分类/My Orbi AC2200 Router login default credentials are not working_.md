                    If your Netgear Orbi AC2200 Router default password is not working, use the configured password. The configured password is that password you create after the first login to your router. If you do not remember the configured password, reset the router to its factory default settings. A factory reset for the Orbi router login requires a small paperclip, a pen, or a toothpick end to push and hold the small tiny restore factory settings button, which is available at the bottom of your router. You can implement the process can be implemented successfully if the router is powered. The power LED light of your router should be Orbi blinking white or blue, depending upon the model number of your router.                </p>
