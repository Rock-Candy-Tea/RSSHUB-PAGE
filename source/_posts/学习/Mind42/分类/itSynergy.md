                    itSynergy has been providing IT Consulting to businesses in Phoenix and throughout the United States since 1997. Our approach is different than most in that we remain constantly focused on the fact that technology is merely a means of supporting and enhancing the objectives of the business. Many other IT Services and IT Support companies have lost sight of the fact that the business is what drives the need for technology, and instead they have become focused on the technology itself as the objective.Our focus is small businesses with a single server all the way up to large mid-market companies with complex multi-server/multi-site technology environments and an in-house IT department and staff.We are located in Phoenix, Arizona, and offer our IT services to cities around the valley and the region.Business Address: 7310 N 16th St #130, Phoenix, AZ 85020Business mail: info@itsynergy.comContact No.: +16022972400                </p>
