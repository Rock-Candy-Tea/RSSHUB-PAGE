                    Theft of a bicycle is a genuine danger that you should be aware of and take precautions to avoid at all costs. Bikes are a popular target for thieves since they are comparatively easy to steal as well as resell after they have been stolen. This is aided by the fact that many individuals fail to take even the most basic precautions to keep their bicycles safe.                </p>
