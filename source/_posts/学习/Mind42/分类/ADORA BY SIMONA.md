                    If there is something that would make an entire dress, it is the accessories. There are also some occasions where this should be enforced, like in a wedding. If you are going to have a custom-made dress, why not go for custom-made jewelry as well. Here at Adora, we can help you make the best jewelry for your wedding gown with our designer Simona. Contact us at 831-247-6354 or email at simona@adorabysimona.com for any inquiry. You can also visit our website and see some of the samples that we have for you: www.adorabysimona.com. We would be happy to assist you with your needs.                </p>
