                    Boredom and lots of free time led me to this site like RussianBrides. Where there are photos of the most beautiful Russian women. Imaginable all stating they are ready to leave Russia for love. By the fourth correspondence the fraud steps in. Now they tell you of a sudden and unexpected family crisis that requires cash. the rest you can imagine. It’s quite a laughable website but I am quite certain that a large number of lonely, desperate men do actually send these images money. Someone should put a stop to these types of sites like RussianBrides.com.                </p>
