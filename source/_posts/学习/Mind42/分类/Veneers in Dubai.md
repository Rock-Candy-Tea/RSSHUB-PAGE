                    Dental veneers are thin shells matching the color of ordinary teeth fixed permanently to the frontal part of the tooth to enhance their look. They are generally constructed from porcelain or resin materials. They are used to fix any issues that result in the unsightly appearance of teeth. Veneers in Dubai are some of the best dental processes available all over.                </p>
