                    This is a fun-filled and exciting way of exploring the great outdoors. Riding a winding mountain trail through forests, up and over hills, across streams and old farmlands, will focus your attention on each maneuver you make!Each day the group will ride trails, use maps, and explore the area’s trail system. Along the way stops may be made for hiking, snacks, looking for frogs, and more. Instructors will teach participants safe riding technique, balance, ascending/descending, braking and bunny hopping.                </p>
