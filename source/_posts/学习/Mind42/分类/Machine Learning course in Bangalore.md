                    MACHINE LEARNING is a different approach to getting computers to act without being explicitly programmed. Machine Learning algorithms are at the core and important piece of data science.  Machine Learning is seen as the “future technology of business”. It is expected to go far beyond the highest level of accuracy and understanding. With its dramatic improvements in the past few years, Machine Learning has taken over the mainstream business as an increasing number of organizations are employing ML to achieve real business results. Now, it is so pervasive that we might be using it dozens of times in our daily life without knowing it.Visit:- https://madeacademy.ac.in/machine-learning/                </p>
