                    A good top-notch weed batch will smell amazing. Users will discern the potent smell of the blue dream strain even when it is packed airtight. As a grower, you need to ensure there is no damp smell. You need to check that the batch doesn’t get a lot of oxygen as the chemical reaction would break down the psychoactive compound.                </p>
