                    The term “Triphala” is taken from Sanskrit, meaning three fruits. Triphala is basically a mixture of dried fruits of three plants that are native to India. Those three plants are Amla or Emblica officinalis, Bibhitaki or Terminalia bellirica, and Haritaki or Terminalia Chebula. Since the ancient period, Triphala has been used in Ayurvedic medicines for many ailments from stomach to dental cavities.                </p>
