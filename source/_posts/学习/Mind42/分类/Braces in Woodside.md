                    Modern metal braces are sleeker, smaller, and more comfortable than ever before. Many teens choose to personalize and add some fun to their braces with color bands. Change the color bands to fit your current style or mood. Simply choose your colors at each orthodontic visit, every 4 to 6 weeks. Which colors you pick and how you arrange them are completely up to you.https://www.jacksonheightsorthodontics.com/treatments                </p>
