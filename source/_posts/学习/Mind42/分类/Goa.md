                    Goa packages are definitely not hard to find and probably your best bet if you want a tried and tested life. The popular concept summarizes Goa as a limited extinction area on its beaches, hippie areas, vibrant nightclubs. That is Goa for the blocked and beginners. But the state is beyond its commercial status in the tourism market. The languid charm of the beaches of South Goa, the tranquility of the old churches and chapels of old Goa and the influence of the Portuguese and the following settlers on their cultural map. In general, Goa tour packages offer a wide range of tourist attractions but you can always plan your trip to include some of the world's most famous landmarks. And you will love to enjoy a weekend getaway from Goa.                </p>
