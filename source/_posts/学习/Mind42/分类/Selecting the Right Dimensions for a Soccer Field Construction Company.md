                    The soccer field layout was rather irregular in its dimensions, and this created several issues for the players back in the day when soccer was in its infancy. While one player would play in a field that is 140 yards, the other player would play in a field that is 60 yards in length. When either team played on the competitor's field, they were at a loss, obviously. The soccer field dimensions were regulated in a better way by the soccer field construction company that can build the right dimensions of the field yards.                </p>
