                    Chocolate digestive biscuits: A digestive is a proper British biscuit dating back to the 19th Century. The name is due to the inclusion in the original recipes of bicarbonate of soda which was believed to help the digestion. A good digestive should be sweet enough to dunk in a cup of tea but savory enough to serve with a good wedge of cheese. A digestive biscuit, sometimes described as a sweet-meal biscuit, is a semi-sweet biscuit.  The term "digestive" is derived from the belief that they had antacid properties due to the use of sodium bicarbonate when they were first developed. https://youtu.be/Dhc9KX8JFaw                </p>
