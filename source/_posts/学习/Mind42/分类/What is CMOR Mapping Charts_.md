                    CMOR Mapping charts use bathymetric data to produce 3D, multi-color, high-resolution charts of the bottom of bodies of water around popular boating regions of the United States. These charts are produced using full-coverage surveys of the bottom with high-resolution echo-sounding equipment. There is no guesswork involved in their production. Everything you see on the chart has been verified.                </p>
