                    The COVID-19 pandemic is raging in India and people are dying for the sheer lack of medical oxygen cylinders. The supply of which is available, but for which transportation and distribution is the main challenge. There are currently a few organized non-profit operations to get medical oxygen to hospitals and patients at home. In response, Ramanan Laxminarayan Founder and Director of the Center for Disease Dynamics, Economics & Policy (CDDEP), put out a call to his network and OxygenForIndia was born.The organization is a collective of medical and public health professionals, volunteers, and concerned citizens around the world. This initiative would not be possible without our dedicated volunteers. Our special thanks to The Center for Disease Dynamics, Economics & Policy (CDDEP) and HealthCube for being the backbone of this initiative by providing their invaluable public health expertise and leadership.Visit https://oxygenforindia.org/index.html for more information                </p>
