                    One of the primary functions of a stretch wrapping machine on the packing line is to unitize the package load so that it may be sent easily and without damage from environmental elements like dust and moisture.In addition to saving money, they also help you get your products to customers quickly.Semiautomatic operations need human involvement, such as the film edge on the pallet, the beginning of the stretch wrapping process, the film cutting process, and so on. Semiautomatic stretch wrap machines may or may not include all of the aforementioned features.Either kind has the potential to halve the time required for palletizing.                </p>
