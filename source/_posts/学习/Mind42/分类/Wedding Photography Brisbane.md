                    Wedding Photography BrisbaneBrisbane wedding photographer capturing all the love, joy and fun times of weddings. Remember what your wedding really felt like, photography is the closest we can get to time travel.Your wedding isn’t a photoshoot and shouldn’t feel like it is. It’s a day full of real emotions, real people and real connections.My goal is to capture all of this and more. I want your photos to reflect what your day really feels like. When you look back on them you’ll remember what you were thinking or feeling in a moment. The way he glanced at you during speeches… that sparkle in her eye… the anticipation right before walking down your aisle. So I’m not a silent observer. I’ll be part of your celebrations, blending with your guests to capture the good times, the moments big, small, quiet, exciting, fleeting and beautiful.Most of the time you'll forget I'm there. I'm a relaxed, easy-going person and my approach to shooting is calming and lighthearted. My couples often approach saying they feel awkward in front of a camera or nervous about the idea of a portrait session. When we’re finished, they walk away saying how effortless, relaxing and fun it was.http://www.storiesbyash.com                </p>
