                    Are you wondering why is my Alexa blinking yellow light? If you have an Amazon Echo device at your home, then you have probably encountered the Alexa flashing yellow ring. This can be seriously annoying for a lot of people because it could easily reveal your shopping to other people staying in your house. That becomes a big deal when you have ordered something for Black Friday.                </p>
