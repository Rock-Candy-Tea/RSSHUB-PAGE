                    It’s time for Botany preschool and that the easy part. The hard part is deciding which preschool is best for you and for your child. Plan on spending some time doing your homework and the payoff is worth it. Here are some important tips to keep in mind as you do. It may take a couple of hours but it will be time well-spent. What is the philosophy of the preschool? Is it academic-based, or play-based? Do they incorporate more than one way of teaching into their curriculum? Children learn in different ways, and every child can benefit from the repetition of several different learning methods being used for the same concept. Also, does the teacher allow the child to do their work, even if it means it might not be perfect or does the child’s work need to look just like the teachers looks?Treetops know that for many children Pukekohe early childhood, preschool, and kindergarten is the first contact outside of the family with other children. All the lessons about sharing and being nice that Mom and Dad have tried so hard to teach don’t really come into play until they are forced to interact with other kids their own age. When playing on the playground or in classroom children are forced to relearn their social skills in an environment of peers not adults who will give in to tantrums and sweet smiles. Because of this, a playground can be the perfect place to reinforce lessons taught at home and in school regarding social niceties. It can also be an important place as it teaches lessons that may not be learned anywhere else. Through experiences such as standing in line for the slide, waiting to use the swings, playing together with toys, and even waiting to talk to teacher, children are able to learn about sharing, patience, and taking turns. Although they may have been taught to share before, having to practice it when playing with another child will teach the lesson much better than listening to Mom repeat it at home."For More Info:-https://www.treetopslearning.co.nz/about/https://www.treetopslearning.co.nz/"                </p>
