                    If you are worried about keeping a record of the Orbi password, you can install Netgear orbi app. Once signed in, you can easily manage your devices and perform the steps to Netgear Orbi setup via orbi app. Moreover, you can also connect to Orbi satellite and begin accessing the settings anytime you want.The admin credentials secure your device settings from unauthorized use. If these settings are compromised, you won’t be able to gain access to the device again. If you think your device security has been compromised, you can recover your password only by performing the factory RESET. To perform a factory RESET, here are some steps you can follow:- Locate the RESET button on the rear/bottom panel of the device. You’ll find it inside a small hole with RESET engraved on the outer periphery.- Use a thin object like a pin or a paper clip to press and hold the RESET button till the LEDs on the front panel begin to flash altogether.- Once they do, release the button and allow the router to reboot itself. Make sure not to restart or unplug the router during the RESET process as it may damage the hardware.- You can now follow the standard setup steps to reconfigure your Netgear router.If you need more info about orbilogin.com setup, visit us.                </p>
