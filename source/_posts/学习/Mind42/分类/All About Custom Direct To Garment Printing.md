                    To get the DTG process started, we first need a digital version of your design. The higher the resolution, the better the print will turn out. 300 DPI is the recommended resolution, but we can make it work if your design isn't quite there. Just remember that lower resolution images may result in a blurry or pixelated image once we print it on the t-shirt.                </p>
