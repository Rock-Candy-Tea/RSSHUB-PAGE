                    QuickBooks Messenger is a newly introduced feature of QuickBooks 2009. This feature helps you to communicate with other users in a multi-user program. Before the release of QuickBooks Messenger, while working in a multi-user mode, you could only see the users logged in but could not communicate.                </p>
