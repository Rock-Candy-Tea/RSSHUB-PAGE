                    A smart sensor can alert you by conventional methods, and a smartphone alert, as soon as signs of smoke, combustion, or carbon monoxide are discovered in your home or office. As a result, you may contact the fire department even if you are away from home, or you could just set it up so that the home automatically alerts the firefighters.                </p>
