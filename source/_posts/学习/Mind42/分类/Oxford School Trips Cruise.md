WE OFFER A FUN AND INTERACTIVE LEARNING ENVIRONMENT FOR CHILDREN.Your class can explore both the Oxford city landscape and the beautiful countryside on the outskirts. Lessons can be drawn from the geography of the river and its interaction with the urban landscape. All our cruises pass a multitude of historical sites from the Middle Ages to the present day and English Literature students can learn from the river's close connections with children's authors including Lewis Carroll, C S Lewis, Grahame Green and Phillip Pullman.Our suggested 50 minute cruise includes the main highlights of river life in Oxford but we are very happy to organise bespoke cruises to suit your needs. The 50 minute cruise follows the route of our Oxford Experience Cruise . Please contact us regarding pricing. We are very happy to assist you with the completion of your risk assessment. Please ask us for a copy of our Risk Management Guide for School Trips.School Trips often utilise the services of our experienced guide, Mark Davies. His lively on-board commentary will stimulate children's interest and more than justify the additional charge for his services.http://www.oxfordrivercruises.com                </p>
