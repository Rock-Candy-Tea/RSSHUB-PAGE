                    Hair loss is progressively becoming a problem for the vast majority who love to eat low quality food, follow an unfortunate food design, and have a focused way of life. Hair loss can also be caused by malaise, lack of sleep, misuse of hair, or unreasonable use of synthetic substances, such as remedies for fading, perming, and shading.                </p>
