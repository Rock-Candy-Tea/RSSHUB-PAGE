                    HealthCube is a combination of smart diagnostics and artificial intelligence to facilitate rapid diagnostics of patients.HealthCube works on a power bank, ideally suited for health camps, door-to-door screening, and rural or tribal areas with limited or no electricity. The diagnostic device weighs less than 5 pounds and is so compact that it can be easily carried in a backpack. It can be deployed to far-flung locations which lack access to doctors and diagnostic labs for efficient and cost-effective healthcare solutions.
