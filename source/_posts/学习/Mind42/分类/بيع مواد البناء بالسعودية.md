                    The year 1996 was the beginning of a powerful start for the company in construction and trading of building materials in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Our first branch was in Bani Malik city, specialized in selling steel and wood products. Afterward, the company expanded to have branches in most Saudi cities such as Riyadh, Jeddah, Makkah, and Taif.—we are still making our efforts to cover all Saudi Arabia regions and we have an ambitious plan to expand our activities in the fields of international trade, manufacturing and agriculture, and to enter strongly in the markets of the Arab region, Africa and North Europe. In order to ensure that we continue to provide high-quality products, gain the satisfaction of our customers and achieve their aspirations..https://mabani-aljazeera.com/                </p>
