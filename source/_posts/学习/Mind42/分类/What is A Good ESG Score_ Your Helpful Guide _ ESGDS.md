                    The ESG Score database Ratings may be a beneficial internal benchmarking tool for guiding decision-making and enhancing sustainability initiatives. An external expert audit of your company’s ESG performance provides an unbiased assessment of performance and how it compares to rivals and peers. This may be a tremendous motivator for action and progress toward performance improvement. The more accurate an ESG score is, the greater the influence on long-term performance it will have on managing ESG risks and opportunities, promoting impact investment, and moving corporate governance toward a more sustainable organization.                </p>
