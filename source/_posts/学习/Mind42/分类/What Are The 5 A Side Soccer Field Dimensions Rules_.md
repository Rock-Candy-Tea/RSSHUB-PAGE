                    5-a-side soccer, the younger sibling of 11-a-side soccer, is a popular, more petite version with leagues throughout USA. 5-a-side features a somewhat distinct set of rules that help to make play dynamic, engaging, and fair for both teams because it is played on a smaller pitch in 5 a side soccer field dimensions with fewer players.                </p>
