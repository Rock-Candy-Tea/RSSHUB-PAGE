                    Once a month, your menstruation should emerge. It varies depending on the lady, but it is considered usual to get a period every 25 to 35 days. These dates are computed by adding the first day of bleeding from one period to the first day of bleeding from the following period. An early or late period, according to IVF physicians, might be a symptom of hormone imbalance.                </p>
