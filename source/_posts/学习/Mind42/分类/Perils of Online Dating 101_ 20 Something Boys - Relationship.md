                    Perils of Online Dating 101. If my finest buddy and I had a greenback for each time a man whipped out his penis on the primary date with no rhyme or purpose, we’d have like six &#123;dollars&#125;. That’s approach too many &#123;dollars&#125;. Boys — as a result of let’s face it, you possibly can’t be known as males — let me be very clear. THIS IS SEXUAL HARASSMENT. Just since you muster up the braveness to provide me an enormous moist one. This does not imply your newly based confidence enhance is one way or the other a justification in your unforgivable lack of self-control. A candy kiss goodnight from me doesn’t imply un-zipping your pants is the logical subsequent transfer. Why? Are you a sexual predator — frantically exposing himself to younger youngsters in the park?                </p>
