                    Buy the new Finland passport with 2020 year of issue. The document has 42 pages. Finnish passports are issued to nationals of Finland for the purpose of international travel. Aside from serving as proof of Finnish nationality, they facilitate the process of securing assistance from Finnish consular officials abroad (or other EU consulates in case a Finnish consular official is absent). Every Finnish citizen is also a citizen of the European Union. The Finland Passport, along with the Finland national identity card allows for free rights of movement and residence in any of the states of the European Union, European Economic Area, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.                </p>
