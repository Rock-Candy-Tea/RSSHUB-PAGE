                    We're always on hand to take care of your investments with calculated risks and good returns. Managed accounts are trading accounts created in your name with one of our recommended brokers and managed by our top experienced forex account manager. The manager is only granted the ability to trade on the client's terminal, but they don't have access to the funds in the separate account as they cannot access the funds or take the funds. Any time, you can alter the password to the trading account or withdraw money and close or open your trade.                </p>
