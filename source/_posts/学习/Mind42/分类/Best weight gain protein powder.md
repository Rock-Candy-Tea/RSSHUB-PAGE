                    Protein is the building block of the human, and the largest macromolecule. It is now available in the form of powder to work as a popular nutritional supplement. Protein is seen as an essential macronutrient which builds muscles, repairs tissues, and makes enzymes plus hormones. The consumption of protein powder also aids weight loss and helps people tone their muscles.                </p>
