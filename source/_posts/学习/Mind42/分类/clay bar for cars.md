                    Though it might seem like a great option of washing your car in a tunnel with machines, the more you do it, the more likely your paint finish will start to develop swirl marks on the car's paint. Automatic car washing does not guarantee that it will get rid of tree sap like a hand wash or a clay bar would.                </p>
