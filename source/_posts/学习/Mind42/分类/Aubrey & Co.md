                    Welcome to Aubrey & Co!We make high-quality, safe, and inspiring teething products and toys for ages 0-4 Years. Our family business makes beautiful baby gifts, teething jewellery for new mums, lovely baby shower gift sets and we are adding to our collections annually.I am Amy, mother of three, two boys, and one lovely little girl. I am the Creative Director behind Aubrey & Co. My eldest was the encouragement behind my small business, when preparing for his arrival I found a gap in the market for beautiful bespoke nursery mobiles and this is where my business began. We now provide services for natural teething products and luxury gift sets for mummies and babies.I spent a long period of time looking for a teether for Grayson that was stylish, effective, BPA-free and very easy to keep clean. But when I couldn't find anything to help with his pesky molars I made a decision to take the leap into designing and creating our silicone cloud teether. The fantastic success and popularity of these lead to the development of our silicone star teether, which is great for little hands and those first teeth.Aubrey & Co has continued to grow over the years thanks to the continued support of our loyal customers (old and new), friends, and family. As the team develops and so do our products and collections, we keep on learning and look for ways to make your customer experience incredible.We were fortunate enough to have moved into a studio in 2016. Since then we have moved to a much larger studio and the Aubrey & Co family has grown. We now have a small team of like-minded ladies working towards the great products you see today and we continue to build on that experience everyday. We are inspired by some other amazing small brands in our community and you will see plenty of collaborations and shared projects with these amazing people.Family-owned, we ensure outstanding customer service – from beginning to end. We have recently taken the big step to open 5 days a week which gives us an opportunity to improve our customer service, speed up delivery and make the most of our time as a team.We really love to hear from our customers so feel free to drop us an email to hello@aubreyandcompany.co.uk to learn more about our products and services.AmyCreative Director                </p>
