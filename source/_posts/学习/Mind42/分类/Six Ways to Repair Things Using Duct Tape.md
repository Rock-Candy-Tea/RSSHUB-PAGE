                    Duct tape may be used for a wide variety of purposes around the home. In addition to its obvious function as a fly swatter, the sticky side has a wide range of other potential applications. It's useful for warding off danger and fixing up problems, too. It may be used as a rope, a cup, or a bowl in an emergency, and it can be used to make other things as well.                </p>
