                    With a toddler around, it might feel like what you do all day is feed, change diapers and try to get some sleep. But there’s one important thing you are missing out on for your baby’s development. While it might seem the baby can’t do much, but it’s never too early to play with them.Even if they aren’t doing much activity, babies still take everything in, and just like feeding playing is another great way to build that vital bond with your little one. https://alphabet-trains.com/blog/post/best-educational-toys-to-help-your-baby-develop                </p>
