                    If you are a person who enjoys home renovation tasks, you may be considering whether or not you should examine your chimney yourself rather than hiring (and paying) a professional to do so. This is not the same as sweeping the floor of a kitchen to clean a chimney. A chimney sweep would also perform a brief assessment of the chimney to verify that it is still in excellent working order after the cleaning. If the sweeping service discovers a problem, it may be able to give additional restoration support to enable the repair of your chimney problem.                </p>
