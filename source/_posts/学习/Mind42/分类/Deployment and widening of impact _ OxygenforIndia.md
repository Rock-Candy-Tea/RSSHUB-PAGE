                    Building the momentum for an initiative at scale takes navigating canceled/delayed shipments and constantly changing regulations. It takes funds.  And it takes a dedicated team that goes out into the field putting themselves at risk.We are gearing up to go live in Chandigarh, Bangalore, Chennai and Hyderabad .We will go live in Ranchi/Guwahati shortly after that.  This will widen our impact and start making a substantial difference to both patients and hospitals.We anticipate some roadblocks in the speed of execution due to: 1.Canceled/postponed International shipments of medical oxygen cylinder2.Changing regulations3.Lockdowns  imposed at short notice to curb the spread (this varies from state to state in India).  With our immensely dedicated team and committed on-the-ground partners,  and assistance of local government bodies, we are confident of finding a way to work with and through this.To know more visit https://oxygenforindia.org/blog/oxygenforindia/deployment-and-widening-of-impact/                </p>
