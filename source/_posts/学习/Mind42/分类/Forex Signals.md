                    Our Forex signal providers interact with us through our website, Skype, Facebook, and email. After logging in to our website, you may access our Forex signals performance page. You can also check your email for the most recent signal notifications. Our Signals are pretty simple to use. Every trade day, before the London markets open, we would publish a signals warning.                </p>
