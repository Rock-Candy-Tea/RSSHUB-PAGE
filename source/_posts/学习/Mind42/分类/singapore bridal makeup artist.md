                    Hi Everyone, here’s a little backstory about Tracy Immanuel MakeUp. I graduated from Cosmoprof with a Diploma in Professional Make Up Artistry in 2007. Tried being a MakeUp Artist then but as I was very young and inexperienced I didn’t manage to be one.Went into Banking doing sales for 7 years and then did Business in Fashion but it failed. Still really glad it happened to fulfill a dream since young and for the experience.                </p>
