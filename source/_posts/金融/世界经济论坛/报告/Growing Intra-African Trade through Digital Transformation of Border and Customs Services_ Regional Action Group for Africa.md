It argues that these can be exponentially improved through digital transformation to increase trade on the continent.

    <p>The paper highlights insights from the Logistic Performance Index as well as key insights from case studies demonstrating the value of digital reforms in various African countries, including Ghana, Kenya and Uganda. It provides a call to action for more integrated digital reforms that can drive higher impact through public and private partnerships that set the course for Africa’s post-pandemic recovery and growth. </p>
