    <p><i>Based on a survey of </i><i>close to 90,000 respondents</i><i> from six countries in the South-East Asia region (ASEAN), this report</i><i> continues to monitor the impact of the pandemic on respondents, exploring how the ongoing digitalization has benefited their life and</i><i> society in the real economy, what stands in their way of further digitalization and maximization of such benefits, and how to tackle these obstacles. It also offers a window into people’s outlook for the world post pandemic. One consistent finding throughout the survey was how the respondents believe technology will play a vital role in supporting their own livelihoods as well as the economy at large.

The survey was conducted in partnership with Sea Ltd.</i><br></p>
