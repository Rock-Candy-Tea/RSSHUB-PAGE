    <p>The COVID-19 pandemic has brought long-term health inequities to global attention and inspired consideration of how to deliver high-quality healthcare to all, even in inaccessible locations. With the use of delivery drones emerging as a potential solution, this report focuses on drone use in Africa – a global leader in the field, with the first national-scale drone delivery programme launching in Rwanda and the world’s first drone delivery of COVID vaccines taking place in Ghana. Using stakeholder interviews, extensive research and a Deloitte-developed cost-benefit analysis model, the paper assesses drone programmes in Africa and how these can be broadened to bring additional benefits.</p>
