    <p>Natural climate solutions (NCS) play a critical role in supporting the future of both climate and nature. Research conducted for this report confirms estimates that NCS can provide one-third (close to 7 Gt CO2) of the climate mitigation to reach a 1.5- or 2-degree pathway by 2030—and at a lower cost than other forms of carbon dioxide removal. Deployed in the right way, NCS can also produce high co-benefits that accrue to nature and to communities. Building off the recommendations from the Taskforce for Scaling Voluntary Carbon Markets, this report sets out five actions to accelerate the scale-up of high-quality NCS implementation and unlock markets through the combined efforts of business leaders, policymakers and civil society. </p>
