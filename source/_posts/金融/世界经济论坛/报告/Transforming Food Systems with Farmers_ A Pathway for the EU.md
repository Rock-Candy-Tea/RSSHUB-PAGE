    <p>If farmers are supported to take climate-smart actions the EU could reduce its agricultural greenhouse gas emissions by an estimated 6%, restore soil health of over 14% of its total agricultural land, and add between €1.9bn and €9.3 billion annually to farmers’ incomes. <i>Transforming Food Systems with Farmers</i>, written as part of the broader effort of the 100 Million Farmers’ EU Carbon+ Farming Coalition, makes recommendations on how to work with farmers to achieve these results.<br><br>The EU Carbon+ Farming Coalition designed and implemented a survey that asked farmers from seven countries, making up a majority of the EU farmer base, about the main barriers to scaling climate-smart agricultural solutions. These included: challenging farm economics, lack of awareness, uneven technology adoption, and fragmentation of policies at the national level.<br><br>Based on these findings, The EU Carbon+ Farming Coalition is committed to accelerating the feasibility and impact of the climate-smart transition through flagship initiatives.<br><br>To learn more about the coalition, please visit the webpage <a href="https://www.weforum.org/projects/eu-carbon-farming-coalition">here</a>.</p>
