    <p>This report, co-authored with Boston Consulting Group, is the second in our series for the Net-Zero Challenge. It showcases the opportunity that all companies have for huge climate impact through action to decarbonize global supply chains.</p>

    <p>Addressing supply-chain emissions enables many customer-facing companies to impact a volume of emissions several times higher than they could if they were to focus on decarbonizing their own direct operations and power consumption alone – and achieving a net-zero supply chain is possible with very limited additional costs. This report shows how.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="st__content-block st__content-block--heading st__content-block--heading-3" id="among-the-major-findings-of-the-report">
    Among the major findings of the report:
</h3><div class="st__content-block st__content-block--list">
    <ul>
        <li><b>Many companies can multiply their climate impact by decarbonizing supply chains.</b> For companies in most customer-facing sectors, end-to-end emissions are much higher than the direct emissions in their own operations (so-called Scope 1 and 2 emissions). By engaging suppliers to create a net-zero supply chain, companies can boost their climate impact, enable emission reduction in hard-to-abate sectors, and accelerate climate action in countries where it would otherwise not be high on the agenda.</li>
        <li><b>Eight supply chains account for more than 50% of global emissions.</b> Food, construction, fashion, fast-moving consumer goods, electronics, automotive, professional services and freight account for more than half of all global greenhouse gas emissions. A significant share is indirectly controlled by only a few companies.</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<div class="st__content-block st__content-block--list">
    <ul>
        <li><b>Net-zero supply chains would hardly increase end-consumer costs. </b>Around 40% of all emissions in these supply chains could be abated with readily available and affordable levers (<€10 per tonne of CO2 equivalent), such as circularity, efficiency and renewable power – with only marginal impact on product costs. Even with zero supply-chain emissions, end-consumer costs would go up by 1–4% at the most in the medium term.</li>
        <li><b>But: decarbonizing supply chains is hard.</b> Even leading companies struggle to get the data they need and to set clear targets and standards to which their suppliers must adhere. Engaging an often-fragmented supplier landscape is challenging – especially when emissions are “buried” deep in the supply chain, or when addressing them might require collective action at the industry level.</li>
    </ul>

        <li><b>Our step-by-step guide shows nine major initiatives every company can undertake. <br></b>Through interviews with several dozen global companies that lead the way in reducing supply-chain emissions, we have identified nine key actions: (1) build a comprehensive emissions baseline, gradually filled with actual supplier data; (2) set ambitious and holistic reduction targets, reducing emissions by (3) revisiting product design choices and (4) reconsidering (geographic) sourcing strategy; (5) set ambitious procurement standards and (6) work jointly with suppliers to co-fund abatement levers; (7) work together with peers to align sector targets that maximize impact and level the playing field; (8) use scale by driving up demand to lower the cost of green solutions; and – finally – (9) develop internal governance mechanisms that introduce emissions as a steering mechanism and align the incentives of decision-makers with emission targets.</li>
