    <p>As countries continue their progress in transitioning to clean energy, it is critical to root the transition in economic, political and social practices to ensure progress is irreversible, according to the World Economic Forum's Fostering Effective Energy Transition 2021 report. The Energy Transition Index, which benchmarks 115 countries on the performance of their energy systems, finds that while 92 of the countries increased their score over the past 10 years, only 10% of countries were able to make consistent gains, showing the need for renewed focus and resilience to meet the climate goals of the next decade.</p>

<div class="st__content-block st__content-block--text">
    <p>This year marked the highest global average scores since the inception of the ETI, with the progress made across both system performance and transition readiness. High-income countries are making more progress in environmental sustainability relative to the rest of the world. Progress in emerging economies has tended to come from improved access and security as countries develop.</p>

    <p>Despite growing momentum, progress in the energy transition requires further acceleration. For this reason, and considering the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is critical to focus on the resilience of the energy transition. As the risk landscape evolves, the transition will fail to deliver the step-change required without building in greater resilience. <br></p>

<div class="st__content-block st__content-block--text">
    <p>The risks facing energy transition are evolving, threatening to derail momentum for change. Rising social inequalities, international cooperation challenges, and geopolitical shifts call for an inclusive and holistic approach</p>

    <p><b>For robust and resilient progress, energy transition needs to be firmly rooted in legislation, consumer awareness, infrastructure and investments.</b><br></p>
