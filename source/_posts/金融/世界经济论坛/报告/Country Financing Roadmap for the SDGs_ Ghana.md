    <p>Even before the COVID-19 pandemic, Ghana had taken proactive measures to solidify its commitments to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), including financing the SDGs as a long-standing priority. In partnership with the World Economic Forum’s Sustainable Development Investment Partnership (SDIP), the Country Financing Roadmap (CFR) for SDGs initiative is part of the Government of Ghana’s efforts to identify, quantify and develop strategies to bridge the SDG financing gap in line with immediate and longer-term national development priorities. The Ghana CFR report is the result of consultations with more than 50 local and global stakeholders - involving public-sector institutions, thought leaders, investors, development finance institutions and other actors - to formulate action plans to unlock capital and financing that will help the country achieve progress towards meeting the SDGs.<br></p>
