    <p>With health disparities increasing around the globe, it is time that all stakeholders, including the private sector, contribute to solutions that improve the conditions that drive health outcomes. While access to quality medical care plays an important role in preserving health, what happens outside the healthcare setting has a much greater influence over one’s ability to live a long, healthy and high-quality life. These factors are collectively known as the Social Determinants of Health (SDoH). Reducing global disease and creating healthier, more productive societies, mainly through interventions targeted at addressing SDoH, could add $12 trillion to global GDP by 2040.</p>
