    <p>The World Economic Forum’s Clean Skies for Tomorrow was founded to accelerate the deployment of sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) and the sector’s broader pathway to net-zero emissions.</p>
</div>
<div class="st__content-block st__content-block--text">
    <p>Strong demand signals for SAF are a core component of that effort. The SAFc framework, introduced and outlined in this report, is a foundational concept specifically designed to enable air transport customers to invest directly in SAF use, receiving in exchange ownership of the environmental attributes linked to the investment.</p>
</div>
<div class="st__content-block st__content-block--text">
    <p>The first of its kind deployed in the aviation sector, the SAFc framework enables aviation customers to take ownership of their emissions reduction goals and further advance the deployment of sustainable aviation fuel.</p>
</div>
<div class="st__content-block st__content-block--text">
    <p>The Clean Skies for Tomorrow SAFc concept and this report are the product of extensive collaboration and consultation across the aviation value-chain, led by the World Economic Forum, RMI, and PwC Netherlands.</p>
