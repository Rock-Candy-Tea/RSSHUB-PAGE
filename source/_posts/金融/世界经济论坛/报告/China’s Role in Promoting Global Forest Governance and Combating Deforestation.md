    <p>Soft-commodity global value chains such as soy, beef, palm oil and forest products cause at least 40% of global deforestation, and China is a major importer and consumer, hence the country has a critical role to play in addressing deforestation. For the last 20 years, China has made domestic advances in sustainable forestry such as in promoting timber legality, forest certification, sustainable overseas forest management, greening of supply chains and legislation. Yet, China can do more to promote deforestation – free commodities if it is to deliver on its <a href="https://ukcop26.org/glasgow-leaders-declaration-on-forests-and-land-use/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Glasgow Leaders Declaration on Forests and Land use</a> pledge. </p>

    <p>The report, <i>China’s Role in Promoting Global Forest Governance and Combating Deforestation, </i>provides insights into the many ways China can step up on global leadership in combating commodity-driven deforestation, also challenges some of the traditionally held myths among experts and professional networks in China. As the presidency of UN CBD COP15, the country is expected to take more concrete actions in the coming phase II meeting in December 2022 and contribute to the global development goals. </p>
