    <p>The June edition of the Chief Economists Outlook comes out amid improving aggregate recovery momentum, yet in a profoundly uncertain environment with widely diverging trajectories. Across countries, differentiated paths are opening up, determined to a large extent by access to vaccines and the financial resources available to governments. This edition of the Chief Economists Outlook explores the most important forces supporting the recovery as well as important developments and risks that could yet delay or derail it. It draws on the collective views and individual perspectives of a group of leading Chief Economists, through the Forum’s Chief Economists Survey and consultations with the Chief Economists Community.<br></p>
