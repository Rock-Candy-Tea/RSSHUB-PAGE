    <p>Companies face increasing scrutiny of their social and environmental performance from consumers, communities, workers, governments and investors. Business leaders are being urged to consider the needs of society at large and of all “affected stakeholders”, as well as their shareholders. This is becoming more apparent for corporate boards, which can play a key role in supporting human rights, especially at times of crisis.</p>
