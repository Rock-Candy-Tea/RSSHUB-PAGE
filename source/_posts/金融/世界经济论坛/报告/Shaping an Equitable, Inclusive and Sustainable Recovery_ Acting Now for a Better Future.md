    <p>As the COVID-19 crisis continues, there is a widespread and profound realization that we must “build back better and broader”, and an understanding of the great danger, difficulties, and fragilities of the economies and societies we have created. This crisis arrived on the back of forces and trends in our societies and economies that were becoming unsustainable — in terms of the environment, distribution and inclusion, and resilience. Change — inclusive, efficient, dynamic, and green — is about opportunities for people, the planet, and business. It is not about burdens on growth. These opportunities can power the next big global leap forward. The report outlines a global vision and concrete, practical guidance to grow forward towards more resilient economies which serve all parts of society and ensure nature and the environment are preserved for future generations.<br></p>
