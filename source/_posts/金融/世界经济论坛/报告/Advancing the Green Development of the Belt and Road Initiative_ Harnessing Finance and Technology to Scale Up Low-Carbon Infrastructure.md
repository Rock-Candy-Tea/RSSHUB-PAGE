    <p>A massive global infrastructure investment of $66 trillion is needed in emerging economies before 2030. The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) offers a new development paradigm by investing in green infrastructure, which is necessary to avoid the irreversible carbon lock-in effect on global climate change. This insight report highlights the low-carbon technologies, green finance developments and enabling environments as well as the broader stakeholder ecosystem needed for green development of the BRI. These are illustrated by engaging case studies based on interviews with Green Investment Principles signatories, multilateral development banks and selected organizations that are harnessing cutting-edge business models to achieve decarbonization and the SDGs. The report is a call for knowledge development and further multistakeholder collaboration to build a sustainable future.<br></p>
