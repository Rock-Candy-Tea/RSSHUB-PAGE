    <p>In 2020 the Government of Saint Lucia, in partnership with the World Economic Forum’s Sustainable Development Investment Partnership (<a href="http://sdiponline.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SDIP</a>), initiated the Country Financing Roadmap (CFR) for the SDGs, a country-led initiative to formulate an action plan to unlock greater financing towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (<a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SDGs</a>) through public-private collaboration. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, the CFR has become increasingly important as one of Saint Lucia’s key initiatives to address the economic and social impacts of the pandemic. The aim has therefore been broadened to not only catalyse private financing for SDGs at scale, but also to support post-pandemic recovery – particularly via regional cooperation – while improving the long-term competitiveness and resilience of the country. </p>

    <p>The Saint Lucia CFR report is the result of multistakeholder discussions with experts, thought leaders and representatives from more than 50 institutions, including public-sector institutions, development finance institutions, banks, private-sector investors and others.</p>
