    <p>The World Economic Forum’s <i>Clean Skies for Tomorrow </i>(CST) initiative has brought together an Indian community of private and public institutions with a shared vision of scaling production and use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). To realize this vision, the CST India initiative established a specific goal to transport 100 million domestic passengers on at least a 10% SAF blend by 2030.</p>

    <p>This report is intended to serve as a detailed roadmap to achieve that goal and includes extensive analysis on SAF feedstock availability and sustainability, production capacity and technological maturity, as well as analysis of resulting social and economic benefits. With India’s increased focus on a national plan for hydrogen deployment, the report also introduces India’s power-to-liquid pathway as a key option.</p>

    <p>Produced through the Forum’s <i>Clean Skies for Tomorrow</i> coalition, this report was developed in collaboration with coalition members and includes signed support from ACME, Boeing India, CEEW, CSIR-Indian Institute of Petroleum, Delhi International Airport, International Air transport Association, Praj Industries, PRESPL, Reliance BP Mobility, Shell Aviation, SpiceJet, TERI, and Vistara.</p>
