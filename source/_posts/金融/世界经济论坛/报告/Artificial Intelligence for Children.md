    <p>This toolkit is designed to help companies develop trustworthy artificial intelligence for children and youth.</p>

<div class="st__content-block st__content-block--text">
    <p>Children and youth are surrounded by AI in many of the products they use in their daily lives, from social media to education technology, video games, smart toys and speakers. AI determines the videos children watch online, their curriculum as they learn, and the way they play and interact with others.</p>
</div>
<div class="st__content-block st__content-block--text">
    <p>This toolkit, produced by a diverse team of youth, technologists, academics and business leaders, is designed to help companies develop trustworthy artificial intelligence (AI) for children and youth and to help parents, guardians, children and youth responsibly buy and safely use AI products.</p>
</div>
<div class="st__content-block st__content-block--text">
    <p>AI can be used to educate and empower children and youth and have a positive impact on society. But children and youth can be especially vulnerable to the potential risks posed by AI, including bias, cybersecurity and lack of accessibility. AI must be designed inclusively to respect the rights of the child user. Child-centric design can protect children and youth from the potential risks posed by the technology.</p>
</div>
<div class="st__content-block st__content-block--text">
    <p>AI technology must be created so that it is both innovative and responsible. Responsible AI is safe, ethical, transparent, fair, accessible and inclusive. Designing responsible and trusted AI is good for consumers, businesses and society. Parents, guardians and adults all have the responsibility to carefully select ethically designed AI products and help children use them safely.</p>
</div>
<div class="st__content-block st__content-block--text">
    <p>What is at stake? AI will determine the future of play, childhood, education and societies. Children and youth represent the future, so everything must be done to support them to use AI responsibly and address the challenges of the future.</p>
</div>
<div class="st__content-block st__content-block--text">
    <p>This toolkit aims to help responsibly design, consume and use AI. It is designed to help companies, designers, parents, guardians, children and youth make sure that AI respects the rights of children and has a positive impact in their lives</p>
