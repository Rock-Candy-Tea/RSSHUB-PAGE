<div class="st__content-block st__content-block--text">
    <p>2. Building on the previous <a href="https://www.weforum.org/reports/two-decades-of-impact">Two Decades of Impact</a> report to understand how social innovators across sectors drive systemic change and reflect on the progress of the community through a pandemic.</p>

    <b>Looking ahead</b>
</h2><div class="st__content-block st__content-block--text">
    <p>The COVID-19 pandemic, which has been particularly challenging for the social innovation community, has underlined the need for collaboration. </p>
</div>
<div class="st__content-block st__content-block--text">
    <p>Hence, in April 2020, the Schwab Foundation and the World Economic Forum together with Ashoka, Catalyst 2030, Echoing Green, GHR Foundation, Skoll Foundation, and Yunus Social Business launched the <a href="https://www.weforum.org/reports/covid-social-entrepreneurs-alliance">COVID Response Alliance for Social Entrepreneurs</a>. The Alliance has grown to become the largest multistakeholder collaboration in the social enterprise sector, with 90+ members jointly representing over 100,000 social entrepreneurs and touching the lives of an estimated 2 billion people.</p>
</div>
<div class="st__content-block st__content-block--text">
    <p>Further, the Schwab Foundation is also launching a new category of social innovation awards in its next award cycle, a Collective Social Innovation Award, seeking to recognise people across organizations working innovatively together towards shared system-level changes.<br></p>
