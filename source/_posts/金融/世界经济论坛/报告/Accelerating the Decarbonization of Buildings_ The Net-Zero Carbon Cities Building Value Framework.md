    <p>This briefing paper introduces the Building Value Framework, which aims to shift how the value of investments green buildings are perceived. The framework proposes a more holistic decision-making approach, recognizing the importance of social and environmental outcomes, as well as system performance. It incorporates a detailed description of both financial and non-financial value outcomes, as well as an operational checklist to support asset owners and investors in making future-proof investments to decarbonize buildings. </p>
