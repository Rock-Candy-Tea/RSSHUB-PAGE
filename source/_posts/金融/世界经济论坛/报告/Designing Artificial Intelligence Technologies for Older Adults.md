    <p>Driven by declining fertility and increased life expectancy, the global population aged 60 years and older is growing at a fast pace and is estimated to reach over 1.6 billion by 2050. Artificial intelligence (AI), in the form of assistive autonomous robots, self-driving cars, AI-enabled health apps and wearables, voice-activated devices and intelligent homes, could tackle key ageing related challenges. These technologies, however, should be designed with intention and should consider privacy and consent. They should also balance the needs of autonomy and safety, protect data against misuse, minimize social isolation and reduce the risks associated with over-reliance on AI. This report provides a list of guidelines that can help support the responsible development of AI technologies that meet the needs of the ageing population.</p>
