    <p>The COVID-19 crisis has created an unprecedented series of challenges, whether it be in our daily lives, society at large, the global economy or the future of the planet as a whole.

    <p>As part of this effort, the Japanese constituents of the World Economic Forum held regular dialogues on how best to manage the crisis, direct recovery strategies and shape a positive post- COVID world. In collaboration with Deloitte, this report was created with these goals in mind.</p>
