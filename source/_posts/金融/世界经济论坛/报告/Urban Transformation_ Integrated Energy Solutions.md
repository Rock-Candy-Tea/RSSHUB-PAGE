    <p>Achieving net zero at city scale requires a transformation in how energy is produced, distributed and consumed in support of these services. This briefing paper shows how the built environment and mobility can serve as the foundations to kickstart urban transformation and decarbonization anywhere in the world. To support the implementation phase, the authors also recommend addressing four critical success factors, namely the push of integrated policies and circularity, data collection and co-benefits tracking, public engagement and district-level initiatives.</p>
