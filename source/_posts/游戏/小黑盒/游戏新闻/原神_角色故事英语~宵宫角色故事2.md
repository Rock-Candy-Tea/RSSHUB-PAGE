<p>「长野原」的烟花备受欢迎，烟花店内总是<b>热火朝天</b>。因此，人们总是觉得，无事登门想必会<b>打扰店主工作</b>。</p><p><b>热火朝天in full swing</b></p><p><b>打扰工作hinder the work</b></p><p>Naganohara's fireworks are loved by all, and work in the shop is always <b>in full swing</b>. As such, people often feel that coming up to the door without important matters might <b>hinder the work</b>.</p><p><br></p><p>不过宵宫的情況恰恰相反。与人聊天是她另一大爱好。要是工作时没人陪她说活，她反而难以集中注意力。</p><p>However, it's just the opposite with Yoimiya, for chatting is her other great hobby. In fact, if there's no one to talk to, she might actually find it hard to focus.</p><p><br></p><p>如果说与上门的顾客促膝长谈是为了「了解顾客的<b>心境</b>与想法，以便制作出最好的烟花』，那为顾客送货上门之后顺势喝茶闲聊，就完全是宵宫对自己的犒劳了。有时仍不尽兴，她还会在归来途中和街坊邻居们热切交流，送上小小的<b>纪念品</b>，并收获一筐零食……</p><p><b>心境mood</b></p><p><b>纪念品trinket</b></p><p>If chatting with the guest is her way of "understanding their <b>mood </b>and way of thinking, such that the best fireworks can be crafted," then going with the flow and sitting down for tea and an idle chat with them after delivering the goods is how Yoimiya rewards herself. Sometimes, if that is not enough, she will make some small-talk with her neighbors on the way, give them some small <b>trinkets</b>, and receive a basket of small treats in return...</p><p><br></p><p>宵宫与人聊天，总能在倾听和表达之间<b>找到完美的平衡点</b>。</p><p><b>找到完美的平衡点strike a balance</b></p><p>Yoimiya is always able to <b>strike a balance </b>between listening and speaking in such chats.</p><p><br></p><p>不<b>赘述</b>，不<b>越界</b>，不<b>冷淡</b>，亦不<b>过分纠缠</b>。一场茶话会后，大家留下的往往都是好心情。</p><p><b>赘述repeat herself</b></p><p><b>越界cross boundaries</b></p><p><b>冷淡come off as indifferent</b></p><p><b>过分纠缠overly invested</b></p><p>She doesn't <b>repeat herself,</b>doesn't <b>cross boundaries</b>, doesn't <b>come off as indifferent </b>or <b>overly invested</b>. After a talk over tea, everyone leaves in a good mood.</p><p><br></p><p>街坊邻居都是些普通人，生活中<b>并无太多趣事</b>。有时，同一则消息会被不同人翻来覆去地讲述，但宵宫完全不反感这件事。</p><p><b>并无太多趣事not exactly full of extraordinary things</b></p><p>Her neighbors are all ordinary folk, and their lives are <b>not exactly full of extraordinary things</b>. Sometimes, the same news will be told by different people over and over, but Yoimiya does not find this upsetting.</p><p><br></p><p>她所享受的是和別人交流的过程——即便是同样的事，不同的人也会有完全不同的看法。</p><p>What she enjoys is the process of talking to others — even if they speak of the same matter, different people will have different viewpoints.</p><p><br></p><p>接管烟花店后，宵宫跟街坊的关系愈发融洽。不少老人视宵宫为<b>忘年之交</b>，常邀请宵宫来家中坐坐，聊起多年前的庆典盛况；已至中年的父母辈会拜托宵宫调解自己与孩子的关系，和宵宫唠唠柴米油盐的家常；青年们则与宵宫称兄道弟，自发帮宵宫搬运沉重的烟花原材料，希望宵宫能提前下班，早点带街上的孩子们出去玩。</p><p><b>忘年之交old acquaintance</b></p><p>After taking over the fireworks shop, Yoimiya's relationships with her neighbors became still more harmonious. Many old folks have taken her for an <b>old acquaintance</b>, and often invite her to their place to sit and recount the festivals of yesteryear. Middle-aged parents will ask Yoimiya to mediate the relationship between themselves and their children and will regale her with the little trivialities of daily family life. The young people treat Yoimiya as a sibling of sorts, volunteering to help her cart heavy fireworks-making materials around, hoping that Yoimiya will get off work faster and take the children out to play.</p><p><br></p><p>「我相信语言有它独特的力量，没有什么是说出来还解决不了的！」宵宫如是说。</p><p>Yoimiya puts it this way: "I believe in the unique power of language. There's nothing that can't be talked through somehow!"</p><p><img class="lazy" data-height="1094" src="https://i1.max-c.com/imgx/2022/08/10/bb0b7b16c1134389bd30f79d1d320cc21660110573.png" data-width="2042" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></p><h4 class="img-desc">多和宵宫姐姐聊聊天</h4><p><a href="heybox://open_subject" target="_blank">#原神2.8版本创作者征集活动#</a><br></p>
