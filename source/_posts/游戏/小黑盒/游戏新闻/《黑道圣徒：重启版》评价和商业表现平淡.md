It has been almost an entire month since the release of Saints Row, and critical and commercial response to the game has been middling. Speaking during Embracer’s annual general meeting (AGM), CEO Lars Wingefors has expressed disappoint in ther resposne for Saints Row, calling it “very polarising”.
“Personally, I had hoped for a greater reception to the game,” Wingefors said at the AGM, according to VGC. “It’s been very polarising. There are a lot of things that could be said in detail around it, but I’m with one hand happy to see lots of gamers and fans happy, and at the same time I’m a bit sad to also see fans not happy, so it’s difficult.”
Wingefors points out that for a more complete look at how Saints Row performed commercially, the company would have to wait for its quarterly report in November.
“On the financial side, I know, or I’m confident we will make money on the investment,” he said. “Would it have as great a return on investment as we have seen in many other games? Not very likely, but we will make money, and that’s a very good starting point at least.”
When asked if the response to Saints Row has changed Embracer’s long-term plans for the franchise, Wingefors responded by saying that he still has trust in the studio, and they will be able to recommend things for the future.
Saints Row was recently released on PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S. For more details, check out our review.</p>
