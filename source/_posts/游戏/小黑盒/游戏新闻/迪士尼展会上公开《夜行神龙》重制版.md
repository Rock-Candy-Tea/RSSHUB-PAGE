The game is currently in development in collaboration with Empty Clip, authors of a King’s Tale: Final Fantasy 15 and Dead Island: Retro Revenge.  Other than that, no footage has been shown nor have any further details of Gargoyles: Remastered been shared, such as release date and reference platforms.

 


The original for Sega Mega Drive follows the events of the Disney animated series.  The player plays Goliath, the leader of the Gargoyles, who aims to destroy the Eye of Odin, a magical amulet that transforms anyone who wears it and comes into possession of Demona, a ruthless Gargoyle, who therefore represents the main antagonist of the ‘adventure.

During the Disney & Marvel Games Showcase was also presented Tron: Identity and the new game with Captain America and Black Panther by Amy Henning.</p>
