Three major properties are coming to MTG in the upcoming year, and we got a deeper look into some of the art from the Lord of the Rings, Doctor Who, and Warhammer sets.
2023 marks the 30th anniversary of MTG, and in celebration, it's joining forces with well-known properties. First is The Lord of the Rings:Tales of Middle-earth set, which will arrive in the third quarter of next year. There will be 18 cards as part of a booster release to bring players into the world of Middle-earth. These cards will also be coming to Arena as an Alchemy set later next year. Check out some of the images below, including The Battle of the Pelennor Fields.
Doctor Who is celebrating its 60th anniversary and to celebrate with MTG, there's a Doctor Who collaboration coming. The Universes Beyond crossover will include Commander decks, collector boosters, and a Secret Lair drop featuring some of the characters and elements from the longest-running sci-fi series of all time.
And speaking of Universes Beyond, the Warhammer 40,000 collaboration is something many MTG players have been clamoring for. We got our first look at some of the images and details for this upcoming set. There will be four commander decks, four Sol Rings--which will be themed after the The Imperium of Man, Tyrandids, Necros, and Chaos factions. Collector's edition cards in the Commander Deck will have the Surge Foil treatment.
That's not all, Wizards also revealed the titles of the upcoming storyline for releases for MTG, and there is a lot coming with some pretty familiar words to longtime MTG players. You can check those out below:
