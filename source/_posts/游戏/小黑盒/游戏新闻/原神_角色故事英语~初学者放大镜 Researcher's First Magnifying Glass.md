<p>小提纳里在雨林里独自探险的时候，会随身携带一个<b>放大镜</b>。</p><p><b>放大镜magnifying glass</b></p><p>When little Tighnari would explore alone in the rainforest, he would carry a <b>magnifying glass </b>with him.</p><p>那是妈妈送给他的礼物，轻便，简洁，一看就是适合小孩子使用的工具。</p><p>That was a gift from his mother. Light and cogent in design, it could immediately be recognized as a tool suited for children.</p><p>「你的耳朵已经能帮你听到很——远的声音了，那么就让这个放大镜来帮你看到更小的东西吧！」</p><p>"Your ears can already help you hear sounds from reeeaaally far away, so let this magnifying glass help you see smaller things!"</p><p>于是提纳里就用这个放大镜，看到了叶片背后的绒毛，看到了蝴蝶翅膀的鳞粉，看到了雨林蛇行的痕迹…</p><p><b>（植物的）叶脉 vein</b></p><p>Thus did Tighnari use this device to see the <b>vein</b>s on the back of leaves, the powder that hung off butterfly wings, and the trails of the rainforest snakes...</p><p>又靠着这一点一滴的观察、积累与思考，被教令院最大的阿弥利多学院提前录取，跟随生论派的贤者大人开启正式的学术之旅。</p><p>It was through this gradual observation, collection, and consideration that he was eventually admitted into Amurta early, beginning his official learning journey under the Sage there.</p><p>提纳里把因频繁使用而<b>遍布磨痕</b>的放大镜放在了崭新的教令院邀请函上，托腮思考了好一会儿。</p><p><b>遍布磨痕scarred and weathered</b></p><p>Tighnari placed the magnifying glass, <b>scarred and weathered </b>by many years of use, on top of his brand new invitation letter, placed his hands on his cheeks, and thought for a good long while.</p><p>最终，他小心地将这个陪伴了他整个童年的放大镜改造成了一件可以装饰在衣服上的饰品。</p><p>Finally, he had this constant companion of his converted into an ornament that he might wear on his person.</p><p>他知道加入教令院后，自己会读更深奥的书，接触更精妙的器具，这个只够初学者使用的陈旧放大镜已经不再有用武之地。</p><p>He knew that once he entered the Akademiya, he would study more complex books and access more marvelous instruments, and that there was little place for this old beginner's magnifying glass.</p><p>但它永远是自己探求知识的启蒙伙伴，也将继续陪自己看向更广阔的天地。</p><p>However, it would always be his companion in his search for knowledge, and would follow him to see lands wider and vaster still.</p><p><img class="lazy" data-height="1600" src="https://i1.max-c.com/imgx/2022/09/11/981ab358e33c46949974153d1a9d43a71662912000.png" data-width="930" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></p><p><a href="heybox://open_subject" target="_blank">#原神3.0版本创作者征集活动#</a><br></p>
