<p>前几日，微软的一份内部文件公开。文件内除了部分独占游戏的独占时长被公布，还包含了一份微软内部人员对于争议巨大的《最后生还者 第二幕》这款游戏的评价。</p><p><img class="lazy" data-height="793" src="https://cdn.max-c.com/heybox/dailynews/img/2f9def3fa2e0940bc0f87a2619e2cb78/thumb.png" data-width="1403" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></p><h2>以下是全文及翻译：</h2><blockquote><p>The Last of Us Part II, like its predecessor, is first and foremost a narrative-adventure game. This is unlike Naughty Dog’s other key franchise Uncharted, where the narrative, while very well told, is there more to service the action-adventure gameplay.<br></p></blockquote><p>与前作类似，《最后生还者 第二幕》是一部叙事驱动的动作冒险游戏。它不同于顽皮狗的《神秘海域》系列，后者尽管讲述了一个优秀的故事，但其更多服务于游戏玩法本身。</p><p><br></p><blockquote><p>While there is plenty of stealth action gameplay in The Last of Us Part II, the game’s primary purpose is to immerse the player in the interactive narrative. The game pushes the idea even further than its predecessor by incorporating a number of extended “walking simulator” style narrative chapters. These play out much like the first game’s stand-alone expansion chapter Left Behind. While these may not be what many gamers are expecting, they are exceptionally well done and really show what other games, especially pure narrative adventure games, should be aspiring to accomplish with their character dialogue, presentation and voice acting.</p></blockquote><p>而在《最后生还者 第二幕》中有着大量的潜入关卡，并以此使玩家沉浸在游戏的叙事之中。本作通过在部分章节中运用“步行模拟”这一类型游戏的某些手法，进一步推进了游戏的叙事体验。这些内容和前作DLC“Left Behind”相类似。也许这些内容并不是玩家所期望的，但本作展示了叙事冒险游戏该如何通过对话、演出与配音表演来实现叙事目标，并且完成得相当出色。 <br></p><p><br></p><blockquote><p>In order to achieve the detail and believability of the character interaction and dialogue in the game Naughty Dog has made a clear choice to sacrifice much of the player’s agency in the story in favor of fixed outcomes in order to achieve the highest production values. That the player doesn’t have the ability to greatly influence or determine the outcome of the narrative might prove anathema to many players and how they view their role in the video game experience. However, we should argue that not every video game must be about the player roleplaying their character’s story. The medium of interactive entertainment also need games that drive stories where you are participating more in the capacity of an active “observer,” just like other mediums of entertainment, otherwise we’re going to be locked into a limited number of stories to tell.<br></p></blockquote><p>为了确保游戏中角色行为的可信度，顽皮狗十分明确地牺牲了玩家在游戏中的主导权以达到更好的叙事效果。但游戏内玩家无法影响或决定叙事的走向，这可能会招致他们憎恶并让他们重新审视自己在游戏中所扮演的角色。然而，我们必须指出并非所有的电子游戏都得局限于角色扮演。游戏就和其他媒介一样，同样需要一个使玩家以“观察者”的身份参与故事推进的作品，要不然的话我们能通过游戏讲述的故事就真的寥寥无几了。<br></p><p><br></p><blockquote><p>The game’s narrative attempts to tell an emotionally relevant story of revenge and its moral and emotional impact on the lives of the people involve, while at the same time trying to create a consistently engaging interactive experience. The player proceeds through two separate, fully realized campaigns; one as Ellie, and another completely different campaign as Abby ------- the woman Ellie has sworn to kill. Other games that have tried this in the past have stumbled by no letting players play as the “hero characters” they care about. But The Last of Us franchise doesn’t really have “heroes”, just survivors. Both Ellie and Abby are well realized and relatable characters and playing through both of their stories does a tremendous job of showing how otherwise decent people can become trapped in a vicious cycle of horrifying violence.</p></blockquote><p>本作尝试讲述一个有关复仇的故事，并深入探讨其在情感与道德层面对于身处故事中心人们的影响。与此同时，本作也在努力创造一个持续吸引人的游玩体验。玩家在游玩过程中将会体验两段独立的内容：一段扮演艾莉，另一段则扮演艾比——那个艾莉发誓要杀了的女人。过去有过相似尝试的游戏都因为不允许玩家扮演他们所关心的“英雄角色”而失败了。但在最后生还者系列中并没有所谓的“英雄”，只有幸存者。艾莉与艾比都是很有现实意义的角色，她们的故事很好展现了曾经体面的人在特定环境下是如何陷入恐怖暴力的恶性循环的。</p><p><br></p><blockquote><p>The gameplay in The Last of Us Part II is an expansion and notable improvement upon the previous game, which gave players little freedom of choice in the moment-to-moment gameplay. Most levels in the first game played out like little “combat puzzle boxes” where there was a narrow predetermined “right way” to finish the mission, which made the effective strategy feel forced upon you. In this new game the combat areas are significantly larger, the enemy AI greatly improved, and the number of ways you can clear a space (or just avoid it altogether) are greatly enhanced. That said, Naughty Dog still can’t seem to make decent gun combat in <b>any</b> of their games, and this one is no exception. Luckily for them it fits in with the game’s overall theme and pushes the player toward using stealth over head-on.</p></blockquote><p>本作游戏性在前作的基础上有了显著的扩充与提升，但玩家在实时战斗中的选择依旧很少。前作中的大多数关卡都像一个个沙盒，玩家需要以一种既定的方式去完成任务，这会让他们感到自己的行为都是被设计好的。在本作中战斗区域变得更大，敌人的AI也更加智能，玩家可以通过不同的方式清除某一区域的敌人（甚至通过潜入避开）。但这也意味着，顽皮狗仍然做不出一套完整的射击系统，并运用于他们开发的<b>任何</b>游戏中。但幸运的是，本作的枪战与潜行系统相当适合末日主题的故事推进（因此问题就不是那么突出了）。</p><p><br></p><blockquote><p>One big gripe about the moment-to-moment gameplay was really with the game’s inventory system. The inputs for weapon switching are all located on the d-pad, and there was no “quick switch” between current and previous weapons. So unless you’ve got an additional thumb on your left hand, then you’re going to have to take your thumb off the movement controls on the left stick in order to switch weapons, which was notably frustrating during the more frenetic combat sequences.</p></blockquote><p>关于本作战斗设计的一大问题就是游戏的库存系统。游戏中武器的切换都位于方向键上，且当前与之前的武器之间并没有“快速切换”。因此除非你的左手上有一个额外的拇指，否则就得将拇指从左侧操纵键上移开，以便切换武器。这样的操作会使正在战斗的玩家异常难受。</p><p><br></p><blockquote><p>The visual quality and attention to detail in The Last of Us Part II is absolutely best-in-class in basically every area, and the overall presentation is significantly ahead of anything that other teams have been producing on console and PC. We were frequently stunned by the quality of the game’s visuals, something that sadly seldom happens these days. It’s even more impressive considering that the game feature two separate player characters with different groups of allies, in different locations, along with flashback sequences taking place years before. It features a shockingly wide variety of environments, weather, and day cycles in locations ranging from Wyoming to California.</p></blockquote><p>本作的视觉效果与细节刻画在任何方面都是顶尖的，整体呈现出的效果也远远领先于PC和主机上的其他任何厂商。过去我们常常被游戏的视觉效果所震撼，但这样的场面在近些年来却很少发生了。更令人印象深刻的是，游戏塑造了两位可游玩的角色，并【在游玩层面】为她们配上了相应的敌人、地点，并伴随着多次的闪回叙事。视觉层面，从怀俄明到加利福尼亚，游戏展现了多种多样的环境、天气、昼夜交替系统。</p><p><br></p><blockquote><p>Players certainly have every right to their subjective feelings and opinions on the game’s narrative,on Naughty Dog’s choice to make players play as diametrically opposed protagonists, or in the game’s final contentious outcome. But as someone who cares deeply about the evolution and expansion of what storytelling in interactive entertainment <b>CAN BE</b>, those things ultimately matter less than how incredibly well Naughty Dog have crafted and delivered the story that <b>THEY</b> wanted to tell. Not every game’s designs can support the level of visual detail they produce, and not every team has the money or talent needed to produce it, but this game sets a new bar for what we should hope to be able to achieve going into a new generation of consoles.</p></blockquote><p>玩家当然有权表达自己对顽皮狗在游戏剧情走向与结局处理等方面的不满。但作为一名一直关注着游戏在叙事层面能<b>走向何方</b>的从业者，顽皮狗创作了<b>他们</b>想要表达的东西在我看来则更为重要。并非每款游戏都能达到本作的视觉水准，也并非每个团队有着顽皮狗的开发预算与天赋，但本作确确实实为我们在新一代主机上所希望实现的目标树立一面新的旗帜。</p><p><br></p><blockquote><p>The Last of Us Part II is the exceedingly rare video game where what it accomplishes in moving forward the art of narrative storytelling in video games as a medium ultimately outweighs whether or not everyone “likes” it or even if everyone has “fun” playing it. They said we loved it, had a great time playing it, and find ourselves still thinking about its characters and stories even after finishing the playthrough. </p></blockquote><p>《最后生还者 第二幕》是一款相当罕见的电子游戏，它推动了电子游戏作为一个媒介的叙事艺术。它不再局限于人们是否“喜欢”它或者觉得它“有趣”。人们说我们爱它，因为在打通游戏后，我们发现自己仍在思考它的角色与故事。 <br></p>
