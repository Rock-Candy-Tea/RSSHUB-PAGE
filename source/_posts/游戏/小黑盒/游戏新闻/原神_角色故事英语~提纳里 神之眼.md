<p>在教令院，无论是求学或者就职，都不可避免地需要参与各种各样的学术会议。</p><p>Academic conferences are unavoidable at the Akademiya, no matter whether one is here to learn or work.</p><p>站在<b>讲堂</b>上的人<b>侃侃而谈</b>，与会的听众热情捧场，这是在学术会议中通常能够看到的景象。</p><p><b>讲堂 podium</b></p><p><b>侃侃而谈 wax lyrical</b></p><p>Those at the <b>podium</b>will <b>wax lyrical</b>, and those in the audience will give their support. This sight is most commonplace at such conferences.</p><p>但严格来讲，在对广阔的知识之海进行探究时，渺小的求知者又怎么会永远不出差错呢？</p><p>But strictly speaking, what researcher, adrift amidst the vast sea of information, will not make mistakes in their investigations?</p><p>就在一场提纳里参加的会议上，一名学者的演讲中出现了与提纳里所知不符的内容。</p><p>At one such conference that Tighnari attended, one speaker spoke of things that Tighnari knew to be untrue.</p><p>那时的提纳里还只是一名<b>旁听</b>的学生，他下意识地环顾四周，周围的同窗和老师们却都没有反应。</p><p><b>旁听bystander</b></p><p>Then, he was just a <b>bystander </b>and a listener. Glancing around his surroundings almost subconsciously, he noticed that neither his classmates nor his teachers had said anything.</p><p>该如何是好？也许大家都听出了问题，却碍于面子不会当众讲出。</p><p>What should he do? Perhaps everyone indeed knew what the problem was, but did not want to make the speaker lose face.</p><p>又或者这个问题只有自己发现，若不说明也许会造成错误知识的传播…</p><p>Or perhaps he was the only one who had noticed the problem, and his silence now would cause misinformation to spread...</p><p>但提纳里在短暂的犹豫之后，还是坚定了自己的想法。</p><p>But Tighnari did not hesitate long before steeling himself.</p><p>身份和场景的阻碍虽然近在眼前，但对于知识的严谨态度还是占了上风。</p><p>Though both his status and the scene were obstacles in his path, the rigor of knowledge eventually won out.</p><p>知识就像夜空中闪耀的星辰，不会被任何事物撼动。</p><p>After all, knowledge was like a star blazing through the night sky. Nothing would divert its path.</p><p>怀揣这样的想法，提纳里举起手来——</p><p>So thinking, Tighnari raised his hand—</p><p>「抱歉，请允许我<b>打断</b>一下…」</p><p><b>打断interject</b></p><p>"My apologies. If I may <b>interject</b>—"</p><p>听到场下传来稚嫩的声音，台上的学者有些惊讶，但很快就反应过来，请提纳里进行了<b>说明</b>。</p><p><b>说明elaborate</b></p><p>The researcher onstage was at first a bit shocked to hear his gentle voice, but reacted swiftly and invited him to <b>elaborate</b>.</p><p>事实证明，提纳里的做法是正确的。</p><p>As it turned out, Tighnari had done the right thing.</p><p>演讲的学者在了解了足够的信息后，<b>坦然</b>接受了提纳里的指正。</p><p><b>坦然earnestly</b></p><p>The speaker, after having processed enough of the information, accepted his corrections <b>earnestly</b>.</p><p>在聆听完他们的对话之后，其他一些与会师生也参与了发言，为这次会议研讨的课题引出了新的研究方向。提纳里甚至还在讨论的过程中收到了一些知名学者的名片。</p><p>And once their exchange had ended, other students and teachers in attendance would also speak in their turn, leading to new research angles opening up for the topics discussed at the conference. Tighnari himself would also receive namecards from some well-known researchers.</p><p>事情告一段落后，提纳里在心中长舒了一口气。</p><p>Once the whole incident was over, Tighnari would heave a sigh of relief.</p><p>真幸运…哦不，或者说真开心，与自己一同研讨学术的人都是认真对待知识的人。</p><p>That was a fortunate... No, indeed, a joyous thing that those who studied alongside him also accorded knowledge the gravitas it deserved.</p><p>这时的提纳里还没想到，更让自己觉得幸运和开心的事情还在后面。</p><p>But he had not yet counted on something still more fortunate and joyous to occur.</p><p>会议结束后，提纳里从观众席起身时，听到了一声清脆的响动：「咣当！」</p><p>When the meeting ended and Tighnari stood to leave, he heard a crisp, clear "clink!"</p><p>——正是一颗神之眼从衣间滑落到座椅上的声音。</p><p>—Lo and behold, a Vision rolled off his garments onto the chair below.</p><p><img class="lazy" data-height="1080" src="https://i1.max-c.com/imgx/2022/09/15/b9070428cd1449adbc44e52ef78a8ece1663206530.png" data-width="1920" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></p><p><a href="heybox://open_subject" target="_blank">#原神3.0版本创作者征集活动#</a><br></p>
