Now for the company sue.  AimJunkies claims that Bungie hacked into the personal computer of one of the group’s key members, James May, and viewed unauthorized files stored on it “several times” over the course of two years.  This was done ostensibly to gather evidence for Bungie’s initial lawsuit against the cheat makers.
According to the portal TorrentFreak, Bungie’s current license agreement allows the company to use certain files on players’ computers for its anti-cheat.  However, the agreement signed by May at the end of 2019 did not include this permission.
Now Bungie is accused of “unauthorized and covert surveillance of personal records,” including violating the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, as well as buying AimJunkies products for analysis and then transferring them to other hands.
Recall that Bungie at one time failed to sue AimJunkies.  After that, the creators of the cheats decided to continue the retaliatory fight, turning to Valve, PayPal and Google for third-party help.  AimJunkies even offered to collaborate with Bungie, but nothing seems to come of it.
