<p>提纳里初至化城郭时还只是巡林队中的普通一员，与其他巡林官别无二致。</p><p>When Tighnari first arrived at Gandharva Ville, he was still a normal member of the Forest Rangers, no different from any other Forest Watcher.</p><p><br></p><p>「比起参加教令院里那些<b>神叨叨的</b>『大项目』，还不如用自己的所知所学切实地改善雨林环境。」</p><p><b>神叨叨的babbling</b></p><p>"Rather than taking part in all these <b>babbling </b>debates about all these 'big ideas,' I might as well change the forest for the better in a practical manner, using what I’ve learned."</p><p><br></p><p>——这是提纳里一从阿弥利多学院毕业就离开教令院加入巡林队时的初心。</p><p>—This was how Tighnari originally felt when he first joined the Forest Rangers, a fresh graduate from the Amurta school who had parted ways with the Akademiya.</p><p><br></p><p>然而刚入队几日，他便发现了巡林队中也存在不少问题。</p><p>But he soon discovered that the Forest Rangers had significant problems of their own.</p><p><br></p><p>虽然队员们都有着保护雨林的热诚之心，但整个队伍缺乏合理的组织安排和<b>科学严谨</b>的工作指导。</p><p><b>科学严谨scientific rigor</b></p><p>They were passionate about protecting the forest, yes, but the organization as a whole lacked rational structure and instruction with any measure of <b>scientific rigor</b>.</p><p><br></p><p>哎哟，想要做出改变注定会遇到困难，但放任不管可不是提纳里的作风。</p><p>Alas, change could never come without any difficulty, and yet Tighnari was never good at leaving things to rot.</p><p><br></p><p>于是行动力超强的提纳里立即着手改善这一现状。</p><p>As such, the highly active Tighnari leapt into action to turn things around.</p><p><br></p><p>建立科学的巡林日志，按照每个人的长处分配任务，定期进行队员们的博物学培训…</p><p>He created a rationalized forest patrol log, assigned tasks according to each person’s strengths, and regularly conducted natural history training for his fellow team members…</p><p><br></p><p>在巡林队的积极配合下，很快，道成林的巡林效率越来越高，尤其是化城郭区域，变得井井有条。</p><p>With the enthusiastic cooperation of his fellow rangers, the forest patrols around Avidya Forest grew ever more effective, especially around Gandharva Ville, where it could be said to be perfect.</p><p><br></p><p>自然而然地，在巡林队员们的眼中，这位博学多识的行动派学者便成了他们的「老大」。</p><p>Naturally, this knowledgeable and highly active researcher would become someone whom the Forest Rangers looked up to.</p><p><br></p><p>于是有一天，提纳里发现同伴们对他的称呼变了——</p><p>One day, Tighnari would discover that he had a new name amongst his colleagues.</p><p><br></p><p>「<b>大巡林官</b>！今天的<b>日志</b>写好了，请你核验。」</p><p><b>大巡林官General Watchleader</b></p><p><b>日志journal entry</b></p><p>"Hey there, <b>General Watchleader</b>! Could you look over the <b>journal entry </b>I wrote for today?"</p><p><br></p><p>「大巡林官！我在离渡谷附近捡到了一个包裹，放在<b>失物招领处</b>了哦。」</p><p><b>失物招领处lost and found section</b></p><p>"General Watchleader! I’ve found some baggage down in the Chinvat Ravine. I've placed at the <b>lost and found section</b>."</p><p><br></p><p>「糟糕，萨古跑哪去了…大巡林官，你今天有见过它吗？」</p><p>"Oh no, where has Sag gone... Um, General Watchleader, have you seen it around?"</p><p><br></p><p>一开始只当是他们<b>口误</b>，但次数多了之后，提纳里眉头紧皱起来。</p><p><b>口误slips of the tongue</b></p><p>He at first took this for <b>slips of the tongue</b>, but many recurrences later, this sign would see his brows burrow.</p><p><br></p><p>「我们这有『大巡林官』这个职称吗？…啊？是效仿了『大风纪官』的叫法？」</p><p>"Do we actually have that rank? Or are we going for something similar to 'General Mahamatra'?"</p><p><br></p><p>…总之，略去过程，在提纳里的坚持下，大家对他的称呼又变回了「巡林官大人」、「师父」或者「提纳里先生」。</p><p>说服<b>prevail upon</b></p><p>Whatever the case, Tighnari would eventually <b>prevail upon </b>everyone to go back to calling him "Forest Watcher," "Master," or "Mr. Tighnari."</p><p><br></p><p>「『大巡林官』听起来可太厉害了，我承受不起啊。」</p><p>"I'm afraid 'General Watchleader' is too great a title for me to bear," or so he said.</p><p><br></p><p>这是提纳里说出来的部分原因。</p><p>「可怕，想起了某人讲过的『大风纪官与大风机关』的冷笑话…」</p><p>"Heh, that actually reminded me of a joke someone once told about the title of 'General Mahamatra'..."</p><p><br></p><p>这是提纳里没有说出口的另一部分原因。</p><p>He did not make mention of this other reason for his refusal of that title.</p><p><img class="lazy" data-height="504" src="https://i1.max-c.com/imgx/2022/09/05/783f410e9adb407380dc626349635fc81662377721.png" data-width="500" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></p><p><a href="heybox://open_subject" target="_blank">#原神3.0版本创作者征集活动#</a><br></p>
