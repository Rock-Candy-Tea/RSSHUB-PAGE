<p>在今日的东京电玩展2022上，《游戏王：冲锋决斗 最强大逃杀》公布了最新预告，游戏将于12月1日发售，登陆Switch平台。</p><p><img class="lazy" data-height="557" src="https://imgheybox.max-c.com/web/2022/09/16/01b9337a13bf89b6aa1e7caa8682533d/thumb.png" data-width="986" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></p><p><img class="lazy" data-height="564" src="https://imgheybox.max-c.com/web/2022/09/16/c2cfe16158e850ef830d0d11fc2fef56/thumb.png" data-width="992" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></p><p class="original-news">            ©          

Sony officially announced yesterday that UNCHARTED: Legacy of Thieves Collection is coming to PC on October 19th.  In addition, the game’s page on the Steam store has revealed that it will support AMD’s FSR 2.0.  However, since the store only mentions FSR 2.0, many people thought that the game would not have DLSS support from NVIDIA.  However, this is not the case, and UNCHARTED: Legacy of Thieves Collection will also support NVIDIA technology at launch.
Naughty Dog VP Arne Meyer confirmed this on Resetera.  When asked about this, Arne said that the game will support NVIDIA’s DLSS technology at launch.
Needless to say, this is great news for RTX owners.  Although AMD FSR 2.0 is better than its original 1.0 version, it is not as good as NVIDIA’s DLSS.</p>
