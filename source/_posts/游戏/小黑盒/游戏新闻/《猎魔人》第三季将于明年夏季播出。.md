While we don't know the exact date as of yet, Summer 2023 isn't all that far away, so expect to see a final launch date sometime in the coming months. Production for season three wrapped only some time back, and as has been tradition since the Witcher series' first season, shooting had to be stalled due to Covid. 
Unfortunately we didn't get to see a trailer or any actual footage of The Witcher season three. The announcement was made by Henry Cavill during Netflix's Tudum event, after which we got a few behind the scenes clips of Anya Chalotra and Freya Allan. Not much is known yet about the next season, but Netflix did release a synopsis a few months ago.

"As monarchs, mages, and beasts of the Continent compete to capture her, Geralt takes Ciri of Cintra into hiding, determined to protect his newly reunited family against those who threaten to destroy it,'' reads the synopsis. "Entrusted with Ciri's magical training, Yennefer leads them to the protected fortress of Aretuza, where she hopes to discover more about the girl's untapped powers; instead, they discover they've landed in a battlefield of political corruption, dark magic, and treachery. They must fight back, put everything on the line – or risk losing each other forever."
However, we'll be returning to The Continent much sooner than summer next year. Also revealed at the event was the premiere date for a spinoff of the series, The Witcher: Blood Origin. Premiering on December 25, this series will be set 1,200 years before The Witcher, and will tell of the events leading to The Conjunction of Spheres, as well as the creation of the first prototype Witcher.
Blood Origins stars Michelle Yeoh as Scian, the last member of an Elf tribe, on a mission to retrieve a special blade that was stolen from her people, Sophia Brown as Eile, a musician who was once a part of the Queen’s guard, and Laurence O’Fuarain as Fjall, a member of a warrior clan. Not much else is known about Blood Origins.
