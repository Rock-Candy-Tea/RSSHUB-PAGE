Square Enix’s HD-2D remake of classic 1995 SNES RPG LIVE A LIVE launched for the Nintendo Switch in July, and as has been the case with the publisher’s past HD-2D outings, the game was met by generally solid reception from critics and players alike. Unsurprisingly, it seems like that’s been reflected in its sales as well.
As reported by Gematsu, in a recent livestream celebrating the original LIVE A LIVE’s 28th anniversary, Square Enix announced that the Nintendo Switch remake has now crossed 500,000 units in global shipments and digital sales.
LIVE A LIVE’s solid commercial start doesn’t come as too much of a surprise. At launch, the remake sold over 71,000 units in Japan in its first few days on sale, while also enjoying a decent debut in the UK. It should be interesting to see how long the game’s sales can maintain their momentum.
LIVE A LIVE is available exclusively on the Nintendo Switch.
