<p>喜欢做研究的人，无论是否乐在其中，对未知的好奇心都是相似的。</p><p>All who love research share the enjoyment of performing that research and a curiosity for the unknown.</p><p>提纳里也不例外，并且这份好奇心似乎<b>与生俱来</b>。<br></p><p><b>与生俱来 have been with him since birth</b></p><p>This is also true of Tighnari, and indeed, his curiosity seems to <b>have been with him since birth</b>.</p><p>在同龄的孩子们还在阅读童话故事的时候，提纳里已经在<b>翻箱倒柜</b>地搜罗父母的学术书籍了。</p><p><b>翻箱倒柜 flipping through crates and shelves</b></p><p>While children his age were still reading fairy tales, Tighnari was already <b>flipping through crates and shelves</b>in his parents' study.</p><p>从研究昆虫的爸爸那里借来了通识课本，又从身为<b>古生物学家</b>的妈妈那里偷拿了化石图案的画片…</p><p><b>古生物学家paleontologist</b></p><p>From his father, who studied insects, he would take general textbooks, and from his <b>paleontologist </b>mother, he would borrow some images of fossils.</p><p>就这样，小小的提纳里一边抱着自己尾巴，一边将大量看得懂或者看不懂的知识收入脑中。</p><p>Thus did Tighnari absorb all this knowledge, whether he understood it or not, while hugging his tail.</p><p>但渐渐地，提纳里发现，当自己知道的东西变多时，想要了解的未知也更多了。</p><p>Slowly, however, he found that as his knowledge increased, the unknowns that he wished to explore also grew more numerous.</p><p>例如，为什么其他人不像自己的家族一样，有着这样的耳朵和尾巴呢？</p><p>For example, why were other people born without ears and tails like that of his family?</p><p>在翻遍了能在家里找到的古书后，提纳里找到了一份祖辈留下的<b>手稿</b>，内容有关「巴螺迦修那」。</p><p><b>手稿manuscript</b></p><p>Flipping through all the ancient tomes he could find in his home, Tighnari discovered a <b>manuscript </b>left behind by an ancestor of his that concerned "Valuka Shuna."</p><p>记录称，巴螺迦修那曾是赤王麾下的种族，生活在广阔的沙漠之中，多数拥有浅色的皮毛和便于<b>散热</b>的巨大耳廓。</p><p><b>散热dissipating heat</b></p><p>As the records claimed, Valuka Shuna were a race subject to the Scarlet King, and who dwelled in the vast desert, mostly possessing light-colored fur and large ears that were excellent at <b>dissipating heat</b>.</p><p>后来灾难降临，赤王的国度因其覆灭，巴螺迦修那则受到了草神的恩惠才得以存活，皮毛也变成了绿色。</p><p>Later, calamity would descend and destroy the Scarlet King's realm, with the Valuka Shuna only surviving due to the grace of the Dendro Archon, which turned their fur green.</p><p>「…值得一提的是，『巴螺迦修那』按照记载来看虽然更像狐族，但名字的含义却是『沙漠的大狗』。」</p><p>"It is worth noting that while Valuka Shuna were noted to have been more like foxes, the meaning of their name was 'large desert dog.'"</p><p>「听我那些和森林关系密切的人类朋友传述，一种叫『兰那罗』的小东西声称为『巴螺迦修那』这一命名负责。」</p><p>"According to a human friend of mine who has a very close relationship with the forest, it was a little creature known as an Aranara that gave them this name."</p><p>「天哪！」看到这里的小提纳里甚是惊讶，「原来我是『沙漠的大狗』！」</p><p>"Oh my," Young Tighnari thought in shock, "so I'm a 'large desert dog!'"</p><p>确切地讲，其实是提纳里的祖先因为和巴螺迦修那共同生活，才因为共生关系留下了这样的血脉。</p><p>To be more precise, it was the fact that his ancestors had lived alongside the Valuka Shuna that they did end up inheriting some of their traits.</p><p>但在兴奋的小孩子眼中，这不重要。提纳里马上要求爸爸在接下来的沙漠<b>考察</b>中带上自己——「沙漠的大狗」要回沙漠去看看！</p><p><b>考察surveying trip</b></p><p>But of course, such technicalities were of no importance to an excited child. Thus did Tighnari immediately ask his father to bring him — the 'large desert dog' back to the desert to have a look on his next <b>surveying trip</b>.</p><p>然而结局出乎意料。还没走进沙漠几米，提纳里就<b>晒晕了头</b>，被立即送回了雨林。</p><p><b>晒晕了头fell into a faint from the heat</b></p><p>Unfortunately, they met with an accident. Not a few meters into the desert, Tighnari <b>fell into a faint from the heat </b>and had to be rushed back to the rainforest.</p><p>「天哪。」在树屋中<b>恢复</b>后的小提纳里非常悲伤，「『沙漠的大狗』在我这代<b>退化</b>了。」</p><p><b>恢复convalesce</b></p><p><b>退化devolve</b></p><p>"Oh no," Tighnari thought sadly as he <b>convalesced </b>in his treehouse, "the 'large desert dogs' have <b>devolved </b>in my generation."</p><p>时隔多年，<b>懵懂的小孩</b>已成长为一名可靠的学者，这段往事也成为了过去的笑谈。</p><p><b>懵懂的小孩ignorant child</b></p><p>Many years later, the <b>ignorant child </b>had become a reliable researcher, and this event had become a joke consigned to the past.</p><p>现在的提纳里，不仅知道了为何名为「兰那罗」的小东西会进行如此命名，也知道了自己为何容易在沙漠中热昏头。</p><p>Nowadays, Tighnari not only knows why those little Aranara gave them this name, but also why he faints easily from the desert heat.</p><p>前者很简单。狐狸和狗在生物学上同为<b>犬科</b>，起这个名字的兰那罗也许特别有文化。</p><p><b>犬科canine</b></p><p>The former is simple. Foxes and dogs are, biologically speaking, both <b>canines</b>, so the Aranara might have viewed them as interchangeable.</p><p>至于后者的原因…虽然<b>不太想</b>承认，但大概就是当时摸着自己头的爸爸笑着说的那样——</p><p>「这孩子的毛发绿得发黑，一定很难承受沙漠的热量吧！」</p><p><b>不太想loath to</b></p><p>As for the latter, though Tighnari is <b>loath to </b>admit it, it probably had something to do with what his father said then as he tousled his hair. "This lad's fur is an intensely dark shade of green. He's going to have trouble in the desert heat for sure!"</p><p><img class="lazy" data-height="4093" src="https://i1.max-c.com/imgx/2022/09/09/e73e98e3edb94791a5772d51a570f4401662714239.png" data-width="2894" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></p><p><a href="heybox://open_subject" target="_blank">#原神3.0版本创作者征集活动#</a><br></p>
