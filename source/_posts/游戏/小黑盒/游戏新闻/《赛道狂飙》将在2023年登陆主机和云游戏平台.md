Crossplay as well as crossplay progression between all available platforms.
Ubisoft announced that Trackmania will be released on consoles and select cloud platforms.  The game will be available in early 2023 on Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Stadia and Amazon Luna. 
Trackmania is currently available on the Epic Games Store and the Ubisoft Store.  The title will also be available via Ubisoft+ on PC, Stadia and Amazon Luna. 
Additionally, Trackmania will continue to be free to play and will include crossplay and crossplay progression between all of these platforms.  In addition, the same official racing content will also be offered on all platforms.
With this new expansion, the Trackmania community, currently numbering over 10 million fans, will welcome new players to experience the full extent of the game.  The range of options is huge.  Players can race on some of the 280,000 tracks created by others since launch two years ago, team up with friends in both Royal and Ranked modes, or complete new official seasonal campaigns that appear every three months.  In addition, players get the opportunity to dive into the track editor with thousands of blocks and objects and let their imagination run wild to create the most extraordinary tracks ever. 
On consoles, players also have the option to upgrade to the two premium access plans already available on PC platforms.  In addition to regular esports events like the Cup Of The Day, these premium access ranks unlock more social and community-oriented features.  For example, the Trackmania Clubs, which allow groups of players to create and share their own vehicle customizations, organize private lobbies, and most importantly, the ability to create your own campaigns and competitions.
Finally, Trackmania will also offer a new feature that will allow players to show off their skills in a unique way.  Because here, advanced vehicle skins can be unlocked in some parts of the game based on driving talent and performance.  Also, to celebrate the release of Trackmania on consoles, more than 150 new blocks and objects will be available on all platforms.
