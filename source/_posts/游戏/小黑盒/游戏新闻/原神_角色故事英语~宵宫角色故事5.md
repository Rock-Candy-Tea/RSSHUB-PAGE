<p>意外抽出了宵宫，泪流满面，又要去锄大地了。但是现在钟离，宵宫，夜兰，班尼特……这四人去游荡，是真的爽！无论碰到什么怪，就是嘟嘟嘟，嘟嘟嘟……</p><p>爽了好几天，都忘记好好学习了。现在继续编文章。</p><p><br></p><p>「霞彩焕花火，花火知我愿，我愿入夜空，夜空自甄明。」</p><p>"The rainbows become fireworks, and they my wishes know, my wishes rise into the skies, and through the night they show."</p><p><br></p><p>这首无名<b>歌谣</b>由来已久。最近几年，孩子们似乎<b>误解</b>了歌谣的含义，认为只要找来亮晶晶的宝物，就能向宵宫姐姐换取只属于自己的特制烟花。点燃烟花，心底的愿望就能在未来实现。</p><p><b>歌谣folksong</b></p><p><b>误解misconstrue</b></p><p>This nameless <b>folksong </b>has been around for a long time now. In recent years, it was <b>misconstrued </b>by the children to mean that as long as they brought some shiny trinkets, they could exchange them with Yoimiya for fireworks that belong just to them, and that if they lit those fireworks up, their wish will come true at some point in the future.</p><p><br></p><p>于是花见坂的孩子们欢唱着这首歌谣，四处寻找漂亮宝物，<b>满怀期待地</b>将它们带到宵宫姐姐面前。</p><p><b>满怀期待地with expectation eagarly written on their faces</b></p><p>As such, the children of Hanamizaka set about searching for beautiful little trinkets with this song on their lips, before bringing them to Yoimiya, <b>with expectation eagarly written on their faces</b>.</p><p><br></p><p>宵宫起初有些困感，但在听了孩子们对歌谣的解读后，欣然接受了这些要求，还给出了独到见解——歌中提到的霞彩，并不是特指亮晶晶的宝物。只要宵宫姐姐认为它「<b>足够闪耀</b>」，无论是小溪中的彩色石子，海滩上的贝壳碎片，宵宫都会欣然收下并如约制作精美烟花。</p><p><b>足够闪耀足够闪耀</b></p><p>Yoimiya was quite troubled by this at first, but after hearing how the children had interpreted that song, she accepted their requests gladly and even added her own spin to the tale: the "rainbows" in the song not only refer to shiny treasures persay. As long as she found them "<b>sufficiently shiny</b>," whether they were colored rocks from the creeks or shell fragments from the beaches, she would take them and make lovely fireworks as per the agreement.</p><p><br></p><p>要是孩子们真的找来贵重物品，宵宫反而会推说它太过普通，并和孩子一起寻找失主。</p><p>Indeed, if they were to bring her expensive things, she might, in turn, say that they are too ordinary, and take the child to look for the owner of those lost goods.</p><p><br></p><p>宝物闪耀与否，其实并不重要。重要的是孩子们有着那样一份<b>信念</b>，认为能交换「花火」的「霞彩」确实存在。</p><p><b>信念conviction</b></p><p>But it really did not matter if the treasures were shiny or not. The important part was the <b>conviction </b>the children had that "rainbows" could indeed be exchanged for "fireworks."</p><p><br></p><p>哪怕在他人看来万分幼稚，宵宫会尽自己的力量守护这些独属于孩童的美好心愿。</p><p>Though some might take it for naivete, Yoimiya will give her all to protect the lovely wishes that only children can have.</p><p><br></p><p>「童年曾坚信的事物，经历过的故事，都会变成<b>无可替代的</b>宝物。」</p><p><b>无可替代的irreplaceable</b></p><p>"The things we believed in and experienced as children become <b>irreplaceable </b>treasures."</p><p><br></p><p>稻妻的传说绘本中往往充斥着如下形象：可爱顽皮的「<b>大貉妖</b>」，威风凛凛的「<b>柴犬武豪</b>」，<b>神出鬼没的</b>「<b>折纸鵺鵺</b>」…</p><p><b>大貉妖Great Mujina Youkai</b></p><p><b>柴犬武豪Shiba Warrior</b></p><p><b>神出鬼没的who appears out of nowhere</b></p><p><b>折纸鵺鵺Origami Nue</b></p><p>The legendary picture books of Inazuma are often filled with the following images: the cute and playful <b>Great Mujina Youkai</b>, the majestic <b>Shiba Warrior</b>, the <b>Origami Nue</b><b>who appears out of nowhere</b>...</p><p><br></p><p>会把妖怪描绘成可爱俏皮的模样，大概也是出于这般<b>用意</b>吧。</p><p><b>用意intention</b></p><p>Perhaps those who drew demons in such cute forms also had a similar <b>intention </b>to Yoimiya.</p><p><br></p><p>孩子们围绕在宵宫身旁，即使身处闭锁之国也能欢喜度日。</p><p>The children gather around Yoimiya, enjoying a gladsome time even amidst Inazuma's lockdown.</p><p><br></p><p>宵宫本人的童心与活力，如夜空中的烟火、星星一般，恒常闪耀，<b>永不黯淡</b>。</p><p><b>永不黯淡never dulls</b></p><p>Yoimiya's own child-like heart and liveliness <b>never dulls</b>, like fireworks and stars that shimmer and shine in the night sky.</p><p><img class="lazy" data-height="2500" src="https://i1.max-c.com/imgx/2022/08/16/e400680dd9194d7c82e02d6f26ca48941660625617.jpg" data-width="4000" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></p><p><a href="heybox://open_subject" target="_blank">#原神2.8版本创作者征集活动#</a><br></p>
