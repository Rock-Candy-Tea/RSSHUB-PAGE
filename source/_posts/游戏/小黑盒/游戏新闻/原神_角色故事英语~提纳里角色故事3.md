<p>曾有一度，林中某种颜色鲜艳的花卉受到了须弥人的青睐，许多人都喜欢将它买来装点房间，慢慢地竟成了一种流行。</p><p>There was a time when a certain vibrantly-colored flower was all the rage amongst the people of Sumeru. Many people would buy it to adorn their houses, and thus it gradually became a trend.</p><p><br></p><p>但是很遗憾，这种花一旦离开雨林就很难存活，即使<b>摘下来</b>也只能维持一两天的新鲜。</p><p><b>摘下来pluck</b></p><p>Unfortunately, this flower was not long for the world if removed from the rainforest, and would only last two days at best if so <b>plucked</b>.</p><p><br></p><p>不新鲜的花没过多久就被废弃，成为堆在地上的腐坏物，无论谁看了都会觉得惋惜。</p><p>Flowers that were no longer fresh would soon be discarded, left by the wayside to rot — a shame by any standard of imagination.</p><p><br></p><p>这样下去肯定是不行的。不仅是垃圾和污染的问题，长此以往也会有破坏雨林生态的风险。</p><p>This could not go on. Never mind the garbage or pollution-related issues, this trend ran the risk of damaging the forest ecosystem if it persisted long enough.</p><p><br></p><p>然而就在巡林队的大家正为此<b>发愁</b>的时候，提纳里却向城里卖花的摊贩提供了一份合作方案：</p><p><b>发愁mulling over</b></p><p>However, just as the Forest Rangers were <b>mulling over </b>this problem, Tighnari would send out an offer of cooperation with the flower sellers in the city:</p><p><br></p><p>巡林队会派人帮助摊主采集鲜花，不收任何费用；但与此同时，摊主需要增加一项服务，告知每位来买花的人，第二日如果在鲜花残败前退回，可以领取一张收据，三天后凭此收据，可以在摊主这里兑换一份<b>干花装饰</b>。</p><p><b>干花装饰dried flower decoration</b></p><p>The Forest Rangers would help them gather fresh flowers for free, but that they should provide an additional service, informing those who came to purchase the flowers that if they sent them back by the second day, they would obtain a receipt that could then be exchanged within the next 3 days for a <b>dried flower decoration</b>.</p><p><br></p><p>干花装饰当然是由提纳里负责指导巡林队员制作提供；至于其中的手工费嘛，是否付钱、付多少钱都由买花的人自主决定，就像<b>义卖</b>一样。</p><p><b>义卖charity bazaar</b></p><p>These decorations were of course provided by Tighnari and the Forest Rangers. The option to pay for them and how much to pay would be left up to the buyer of the flowers, just as things might go at a <b>charity bazaar</b>.</p><p><br></p><p>这些钱除了一部分会分给店主作为回收<b>残花</b>的辛苦费，剩下的则会成为巡林队维护雨林的经费。</p><p><b>残花leftover flowers</b></p><p>Part of this Mora would go to the store owner as service charge for collecting the<b>leftover flowers</b>, and the rest would be used for funding the Forest Rangers' efforts to maintain the rainforest.</p><p><br></p><p>合作进行得十分顺利：摊主省去了深入雨林找花采花的麻烦，还增加了收入；巡林队用科学的方案控制了采摘花朵的过程和数量，也同时获得了额外的经费；付钱买花的人不仅获得了短时间内的鲜花陪伴，还能拿到一份可以<b>长久保存的纪念品</b>。</p><p><b>长久保存的纪念品 permanent memento</b></p><p>This cooperation went quite smoothly indeed. The flower shop owners saved themselves the trouble of searching deep within the rainforest for their floral quarry and got some extra income; the Forest Rangers got to control the process and amount of flowers gathered, and also got some extra funds; those who bought flowers would not only receive a temporary flower as a companion, but also a more <b>permanent memento</b>.</p><p><br></p><p>结果<b>很圆满</b>，但巡林队中仍有人不解：「为什么不一开始就禁止采摘这种花呢？难道这不是更简单的办法吗？」</p><p><b>很圆满quite swimmingly</b></p><p>This all went <b>quite swimmingly</b>, but some rangers did not understand, asking: "Why didn't we just ban the gathering of such flowers in the first place? Wouldn't that have been simpler?"</p><p><br></p><p>提纳里听到这样的疑问后连连摇头，耳朵直晃。</p><p>Tighnari shook his head when he heard this answer, causing his ears to shake.</p><p><br></p><p>「不能这样简单计算。如果下达强制的要求，就会变得像死板的老师教大家做事一样，不但得不到人们的理解，甚至会<b>引起逆反心理</b>。」</p><p><b>引起逆反心理stirs up feelings of rebellion</b></p><p>"We shouldn't make such simple calculations. If we were to force our requests through, we would be just like a stolid lecturer who fails to have others understand, but who <b>stirs up feelings of rebellion </b>instead."</p><p><br></p><p>「到时候，就算不在乎巡林队的风评，光是处理违规偷花的人就够我们忙的了！」</p><p>"If that were to happen, our reputation would be the least of our woes — we would have our hands full trying to deal with those who were coming to pick flowers illegally!"</p><p><br></p><p>「而且流行的趋势是会变的，不用担心，过不了多久人们就会将注意力转移到别处去了。」</p><p>"In any case, trends will change. Don't worry. I'm sure the people's attention will shift to something else soon."</p><p><br></p><p>这番话非常<b>务实</b>，立即得到了巡林队员们的<b>认可</b>，尤其是柯莱的头点得最为用力。</p><p><b>务实Pragmatic</b></p><p><b>认可traction</b></p><p><b>Pragmatic</b>as these words were, they quickly found <b>traction </b>with the Forest Rangers. Collei's nods were particularly rapid.</p><p><br></p><p>「用师父教的办法做的干花饰品，在孩子们中也很受欢迎呢！」</p><p>"The dried flower decorations that Master taught us to make have been pretty popular with the children, too!"</p><p><img class="lazy" data-height="500" src="https://i1.max-c.com/imgx/2022/09/06/00b38fdbbeb940bea9f8632c687e6f3a1662454522.png" data-width="509" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></p><p><a href="heybox://open_subject" target="_blank">#原神3.0版本创作者征集活动#</a><br></p>
