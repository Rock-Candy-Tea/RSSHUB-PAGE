He went on to say that he was "very, very sure" that Twilight Princess and Wind Waker HD would be announced at what would be a "Zelda blowout" of a Direct. However, Grubb has now doubled down on his claim and has also included the long-awaited Breath of the Wild sequel.
As spotted by NintendoLife, Grubb reiterated on his earlier claims about the Direct, but added that he received new information about Breath of the Wild 2 making an appearance. "...A lot of Zelda stuff, now I said the word "blowout" everyone is hyper-fixated on [that]...I don't know what their [Nintendo] exact plans are, I suspect, and it's been intimated to me... this is probably happening that we will probably get the name of Breath of the Wild 2, and we will also get the ports of the Wii U HD transfers of Wind Waker and Twilight Princess," he said in a conversation with Nintendo Shack.

Nintendo has been really quiet about the sequel to Breath of the Wild. All we've seen as of now is the brief announcement trailer that Nintendo revealed during E3 2019, and a short video in 2021, showcasing some of the new enemies, powers, and mechanics the game will feature. We still don't know much about the story,or where it picks up from, but one of the main theories about this game is that we might get to play as Zelda.
Elsewhere in the conversation, Grubb also mentioned that A Metroid Prime remaster could be in the works, with a possible launch during this holiday season. Lastly, he corroborated rumours that It Takes Two could be coming to the Nintendo Switch.
Of course, while Jeff Grubb has a good record when it comes to inside information, do not take this to be an official announcement. We know Nintendo can be a fickle at times, and could possibly change the showcase at the last moment. After all, he did conclude by saying that the company is sitting on loads of ready but unannounced material.
