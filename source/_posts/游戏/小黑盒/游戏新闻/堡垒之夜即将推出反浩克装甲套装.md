The Fortnite-Marvel collaboration continues with the latest outfit being Spideverse’s Spider-Gwen.  Now we’re getting the first hint of another Zero suit, this time for everyone’s favorite billionaire superhero, Iron Man.
Fortnite insider HypeX has posted several shots of Iron Man in his Zero Suit showing him in the store.  It appears that the Iron Man suit is based on the Hulkbuster suit, a super-heavy power armor that was designed to counter the Hulk.  He seems to have a slightly different color scheme and a few different helmet options, or a more original Iron Man helmet.


This leak likely means that the fifth and final part of the five-part Fortnite x Marvel: Zero War comic is on the way.  The fourth issue of Zero War was released last month, along with the Wolverine costume, and previous issues have already come out with Iron Man-themed cosmetics.  The Zero War comics began with a new suit for Spider-Man that appears to be a replica of Iron-Man Zero’s design.</p>
