The developers of the mystical adventure Oxenfree II: Lost Signals announcedthat their project will have to wait a little longer than planned.  The release should take place only in 2023.
 
The authors of the game want to spend more time improving its various aspects, as well as adding support for additional languages.  It is already known that the menu and subtitles will be translated into Russian there.
“We owe it to our amazing community to make Oxenfree II: Lost Signals the best game it can be.  Seeing your fan art, reading your enthusiastic comments, and talking to you fuels our drive to make this our best game yet.  To make Oxenfree II truly special and add more localizations, we are moving the release window to 2023.  Thank you for your patience, support and understanding.  We can’t wait to share the game with you.  Keep for updates!”  – the developers address the fans in their new message. 
 
Oxenfree II: Lost Signals is the sequel to the critically acclaimed adventure game from Night School Studio.  In the story, five years ago, a group of teenagers accidentally opened a portal on Edwards Island and created a gap between realities and time periods.  Now members of a mysterious cult-like organization called the Legacy are trying to open a new portal to pull something off.  The player will need to figure out who they are and what they want.
“TVs turn on and off.  Planes go off course.  Radio stations cannot broadcast due to interference.  In the coastal town of Kamen, unusual electromagnetic waves suddenly interfere with electrical and radio equipment.  Riley Powerly reluctantly returns to her hometown to investigate this mystery, but finds much more than she expected,” the authors reveal plot details.
