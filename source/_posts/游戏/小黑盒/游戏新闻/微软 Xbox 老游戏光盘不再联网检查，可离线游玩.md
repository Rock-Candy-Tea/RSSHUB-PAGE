Microsoft has finally listened to the owners of their consoles.  The company has, however, loosened up its bizarre security measures that require a constant connection to the network.  With the new update 2206 for Xbox Series X, playing games from discs will be easier and faster.
The new console firmware has saved players from being forced to connect to the network while using the disc.  As Microsoft representatives note, it is true that now most drives do not need an active Internet connection.  Xbox One games will be able to run offline, however, some projects will still require mandatory installation of patches.
This is the first time in a long time that built-in DRM protection has been weakened on Xbox consoles.  I am glad that the company, in addition to constantly expanding the Game Pass subscription, still reads the reviews of its consumers, although the console interface for many is still the main problem.</p>
