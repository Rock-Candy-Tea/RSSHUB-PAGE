As you may recall, last month Microsoft assured that the price of the Xbox Series X | S will not go up after the sensational announcement of the PS5 price increase, and here Spencer has explained the matter more in depth.
“We always find ourselves evaluating our business as we move forward, so clearly we can’t say that something will never happen,” said the Microsoft Gaming CEO.  “However, looking at our consoles today, we believe that perceived value is extremely important and we greatly appreciate the position of the Xbox Series S in this regard.”
“So I can definitely say that today we have no intention of increasing the price of our consoles. We think that at a time when users are in the most difficult economic period ever, it would not be the right move.”
Speaking of perceived value, we remind you of all the games announced for Xbox Game Pass at Tokyo Game Show 2022.</p>
