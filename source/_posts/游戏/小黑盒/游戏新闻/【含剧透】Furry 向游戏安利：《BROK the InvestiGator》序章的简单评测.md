<h2>前言</h2><b>剧透警告！</b><p>之所以想写这篇评测，主要原因就是因为——这款游戏太好玩了！</p><p>另外，这是我第一次写关于游戏的评测，不太清楚应该如何下笔，只能想到啥写啥，还望各位海涵。</p><p><i>（在写这篇文章时，我是坐在麦当劳里边写边吃东西的，如果你越看越饿，属于正常现象，Don't panic :P）</i></p><h2>正文</h2><p>首先，让我先聊一聊这款游戏有哪些优点，这些优点是它的闪光点，是能让我产生游玩欲望并想为它撰写一篇文章的动机。</p><h3>优点</h3><p>第一点，也是最重要的一点，就是它是一款“毛茸茸”题材的游戏，如果它没有这类元素，我可能都不会发现这款游戏……光是这点就足以让我产生玩下去的欲望。但光有这点还不行，众所周知，每个作品的角色构建起来都是极其困难的，想让里面的角色充满“立体感”，就需要让作品产生“代入感”。关于这点，《BROK the InvestiGator》<i>（以下简称《BROK》）</i>就做到了。在我游玩的过程中，里面的每名角色都十分鲜活，体验时都能感受到他们都是些有血有肉的人。仿佛就在我的面前，或让我置身于他们的世界中，与他们实打实地聊天，让我有足够的“收藏品广告券”深入剧情体验他们的故事。光是这一点就让我足够喜欢这款游戏了！</p><p><img class="lazy" data-height="799" src="https://imgheybox.max-c.com/bbs/2021/11/28/fa4ae774c91b19c919a8bb6a788b93f2/thumb.png" data-width="1440" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></p><h4 class="img-desc">目前本游戏拥有的部分主要角色！</h4><p>其次是《BROK》中剧情拥有不同的分支，这个想法很不错，但实际制作起来仍是十分艰难的<i>（没错，我有这方面的经验，虽然现在我正在撰写的那篇故事仍在制作中（其实是卡壳了））</i>。就序章来看，似乎目前只有主线这一条剧情线可以走，希望在正式版中能够出现至少两条截然不同的路线吧。<br></p><p><i>（修正：啊，刚刚查阅了一下游戏正式版的介绍，发现可以通过多周目达成不同的结局，好耶！）</i></p><p><img class="lazy" data-height="844" src="https://imgheybox.max-c.com/bbs/2021/11/28/2c78edb3d67811c6b0862e954d9976b8/thumb.png" data-width="1440" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></p><h4 class="img-desc">类似于《底特律：变人》一样的路线分支玩法</h4><p>接着是它的本地化做的巨棒无比！这点我吹爆好吧！能支持简体中文的外国游戏本就不多，甚至连某些三A游戏厂商都不重视，而《BROK》却做到了，对，它又做到了，而且做的还不错！一开始我是打算边啃生肉边查阅字典的，虽然不能完全get到梗，但八九不离十还是可以的大概，结果发现竟然自带了简体中文的语言包！而且还翻译成了适合于国人的阅读方式，梗也尽可能地翻译了过来，可以看出制作组对于这款游戏十分用心了，体验感蹭蹭往上涨！<br></p><p><img class="lazy" data-height="844" src="https://imgheybox.max-c.com/bbs/2021/11/28/088d309382200b7b220a49fa042ddb66/thumb.png" data-width="1440" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></p><h4 class="img-desc">多语言支持</h4><p><i>（啊，汉堡不知不觉就吃光了，麦当劳的汉堡越来越小了。伤心。）</i></p><p>然后是《BROK》的游戏流程足够长，光是序章这一章就让我足足打了六个多小时<i>（现在是7个小时了）</i>，而官方声称序章的游戏时间只有两个小时？！What's up？！那么我简单推理一下，如果后续章节的游戏时间呈阶梯式下降，那我也得需要至少30~50个小时才能通关一周目……太可怕了，希望我到时候还有时间体验吧。😂</p><p><img class="lazy" data-height="214" src="https://imgheybox.max-c.com/bbs/2021/11/28/f87bb184783ee749c8a9cc6c09ba80b0/thumb.png" data-width="491" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></p><h4 class="img-desc">光序章就将近8小时，正式版可不得了</h4><p>以及它的配音也足够优秀，整体感觉也很棒<i>（当然，除了序章，这是一个减分项，我会在缺点中详细阐述为什么）</i>，代入感很足。从这章我能够感受到阿信的紧张、流浪汉的沧桑、格拉夫的放荡不羁……</p><p>最后是该游戏的背景音乐做的也很棒，尤其是最后的推理流程中使用了循序渐进式的BGM是一种十分值得学习的处理方式，能够让玩家在享受剧情推进的流程中还可以进一步提升沉浸感。<i>（老实说，一开始玩的时候我甚至都没留意，直到最后才发现：哇——这里的音乐竟然是这样的？）</i></p><p><img class="lazy" data-height="844" src="https://imgheybox.max-c.com/bbs/2021/11/28/41ea9026d0210367df3ecf0d9f9b4c6b/thumb.png" data-width="1440" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></p><h4 class="img-desc">结尾的推理环节真的很有意思！</h4><p>以上是我初步体验《BROK》所总结的些许优点，接下来我简单谈谈这个序章的缺点。</p><p><i>（先让我把这点儿薯条吃完了再继续写！）</i></p><h3>缺点</h3><p>说是缺点，其实倒也没啥可说的，因为游戏优化的已经很不错了，基本上玩的时候挑不出啥刺儿了已经。</p>不过！倒是有一个缺点，就是在“序幕”那节剧情<i>（Brok的梦境）</i>的配音属实有些突兀，声音时大时小，而且配音演员配的角色似乎在开始并没能代入<i>（或者太过了）</i>，直到正式章节才有所好转。这也导致了我在刚开始游玩时也产生了难受的突兀感，鸡皮疙瘩掉一地，险些没能继续玩下去导致错过了这款游戏。不过随着剧情的推进，配音演员的配音也变得越来越好了，慢慢地就代入到了这个世界观中。<p>希望可以进一步完善一下这里的配音。</p><p>没了，我就发现这么一点不太好的地方。</p><p><i>（修正：几天前我看了官方的直播游玩，发现序幕那里的配音比初次玩的时候好多了，也许是自己的错觉。）</i></p><h2>后记</h2><p>总体来说，光就序章来看，这款独立游戏的完成度已经十分高了，很是期待正式发行版，期待后面的剧情！</p>另外，我真的十分超级特别喜欢阿信这个角色！主要是他的性格和声音很戳我<i>（很可爱的感觉，有点儿纸片人公园里特维克·特威克的味儿了）</i>，希望在后续剧情中他可以成为一个推进主线剧情的关键人物，以及请给他一个好结局吧！谢谢呜呜呜。<p>至于打击方面<i>（打斗模式）</i>的游戏体验，因为我不怎么使用那个模式，大部分时间是在沉浸于解密所带来的快感中，不怎么了解，所以就不发表评价了。</p><p>还有最最最重要的一点！！没能才遇到年初的游戏众筹是我最大的遗憾！等未来游戏发布，我必定第一时间入手！！</p><p>以及要是以后我有时间，我也要尝试画一幅《BROK》的艺术作品。Just you wait!</p><p>最后，这款游戏真的很有意思，五星力荐！</p><p>以及感谢 <a href="https://space.bilibili.com/6474835/" target="_blank">@白辰</a> 进行的翻译校对。</p><p>以上。</p><p>感谢你的阅读。</p><p><i>（PS：可乐也喝完了，收拾收拾走人，到家截几张图再校对一下试着翻译成英文 UwU）</i></p><p><i><br></i></p><p><br></p><p><i>思来想去要不要顺便贴一下翻译成英文的版本，最后还是决定加上，反正都写了<span data-emoji="cube_感动" class="hb-emoji"></span></i></p><p><i>以及请忽略语法及措辞问题，请原谅我的工地英语<span data-emoji="cube_委屈" class="hb-emoji"></span></i></p><h2>Before Start</h2><b>Spoiler Alert!<br></b>The main reason why I want to write this review is that- this game is very funny and fascinating!<p>Also, it is my first time to write a review about the game, so I'm not sure what I should write, and I'll just write whatever in my mind. Please forgive me for this.</p><p><i>(Warning: I'm sitting in McDonald's while writing and eating, if you feel hungry when you are reading, it is just a normal phenomenon. Please don't panic. :P)</i></p><h2>Review</h2><p>At first, let me talk about the game's advantages. These advantages are the key points that makes me want to play and write a comment about this game.</p><h3>Advantages</h3><p>The first reason <i>(the most important reason)</i> is that this game has a lots of furry elements. If it does not have them, I think I would not find this game... So the reason why I play this game is that it is a furry game haha. But, what's more, as we know, it's extremely difficult to design the characters in everyone's work. To make the characters more "three-dimensional", we need to make the work give the readers a immersive feeling. With respect to this, BROK the InvestiGator makes it <i>(And I will call it "BROK game" in the following writing)</i>.  Every character makes me feel that they're alive and flesh out in the storyline when I am playing BROK game. As if they are in front of me, or I enter their world, and talk with them face to face, it enables me to have enough "Ads" to experience their story and learn more about them. In summary, this reason alone makes me love this game!</p>The second advantage is that this game have different storyline<i>s</i>, which is a perfect idea, but, you know, it's extraordinary difficult when you start to write stories <i>(Yeah, I have some experience about this actually, although I'm still writing my own original story now and it still gets stuck now T^T)</i>. But it seems that I can only finish one storyline in the prologue, and I hope there will be at least two very different storylines in the release version.<p><i>(Note: Ahh, I looked into the release version's introduction a moment ago, and then I saw that I can finish different ends in multiple storylines. Hooray!)</i></p><p>Next, BROK game has such excellent translation of languages! I'm very excited! There are only a few international games that support the Simplified Chinese, and even some triple-A game companies don't pay attention to this. But, BROK game makes it <i>(Yup, this game makes it, again)</i>, and it turns out to be quite good! Honestly, I plan to read the story and the dictionary at same time at first. Although I can't understand all memes, still I think I can understand a little at least. But there is already Simplified Chinese in the game! It shocked me! Also, the memes that conforms to Chinese reading habits are translated very well. So I can feel the sincerity of the developers of this game, [EXP level up!].</p><p><i>(Oh no, the hamburger was totally eaten, but when?! I don't know yet. And McDonald's hamburgers are getting smaller and smaller. Sad.)</i></p><p>Moreover, there is enough time to experience the BROK game stories. I played almost 6 hours to experience the prologue - one chapter (Now is the 7th hours). But the official said: it takes only need 2 hours to experience the prologue! What the....?! So let me try some "simple analysis", if the gaming time in next chapters decreases step by step, I still need 30 ~ 50 hours to finish the story for the first time at least...... Terrible, so terrible. Just hope I have enough time to play it when the game releases. 😂</p><p>Also this game's voice effect is great, and I can feel the characters' emotions. Like Sin's tension, Tramp's vicissitude, Graff's wild oats. <i>(But the first episode is not so desirable, which I will explain why later.)</i></p><p>In the end, this game's original soundtrack is really great too, especially the final reasoning episode, and it is worth noticing that the progressive <i>(step-by-step)</i> style background music plays an important role in the whole process. That style can let players enjoy the stories while also further enhancing the immersion.</p><p><i> (Frankly speaking, I do not pay attention about this, and when the reasoning ends, I realized it suddenly: Woah! The music is so special!)</i></p>In summary, they're some advantages when I experience the prologue of the BROK game at first time, and I will talk about the prologue's disadvantages next.<p><i>(Let me eat these french fries first!)</i></p><h3>Disadvantages</h3><p>In regard to disadvantages... Actually nothing is about to say, because the game is developed really well now. When I play the prologue, it almost does not have any bug.</p>But, still it has a disadvantage actually. The first episode's voice seems a little bit weird <i>(in Brok's dream)</i>, because the volume of voice varies abruptly <i>(suddenly loud and low)</i>, and I think voice actors don't express enough emotions <i>(or express too much)</i> when they do dubbing in this episode. In the next episode, it gets better. This also led to an uncomfortable feeling of abruptness when I start to play for the first time. It "freaked me out" to some extent, and I almost stopped continue to play. But when I continue to play, actors emotions become better than that of the first episode, so I gradually immerse myself in this world.<p>Anyway, I hope the voice emotions can be better in the first episode.</p><p>That's all, I just have one suggestion like this.</p><p><i>(Note: A few days ago I watched the official game live and the voice there in the Episode 1 was much better than the one that I first experienced. Maybe it is just my illusion.)</i></p><h2>Epilogue</h2><p>All in all, this indie game's achieves great completeness just for the prologue.</p>I'm really looking forward to the release version, and expect the next story!<p>By the way, I really like the character - Sin! It is because I like his personality and voice haha. xD <i>(He is a little bit like Tweek Tweak in South Park, I thought)</i> Hope he can be a key role in the next story and please let him have a happy ending!! Pleeeeeeease-!</p><p>About the Beat 'em up mode... I don't often play that mode actually, and I immerse myself in solving the puzzles for almost all the time... So I will not post comments on that part because I don't know so much about that part.</p><p>And I have a very important and significant thing to say!!! The fact that I WAS NOT ABLE TO join the game crowdfunding at the beginning of this year is my BIGGEST mistake! I WILL DEFINITELY buy the game once it releases!</p><p>And when I have free time in the future, I will try drawing a picture about this game. Just you wait!</p><p>In the end, this game is really interesing, [Recommend level MAX]!</p><p>And thanks <a href="https://twitter.com/Ted0621" target="_blank">@Ted</a> for translation proofreading.</p><p>That's all, thanks for your reading.</p><p><i>(Ps: Finish drinking cola. It's time to leave. Take some screenshots when I go back home. UwU)</i></p><p><br></p><p><a href="heybox://open_subject" target="_blank">#BROK the InvestiGator#</a> <a href="heybox://open_subject" target="_blank">#单机游戏#</a> <a href="heybox://open_subject" target="_blank">#steam游戏#</a> <a href="heybox://open_subject" target="_blank">#furry游戏#</a> <a href="https://api.xiaoheihe.cn/maxnews/app/share/detail/2323367" target="_blank">#游戏推荐#</a></p><p><img data-gameid="1318790" src="https://cdn.max-c.com/heybox/game/header/1318790_4AFgV.jpg" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></p>
