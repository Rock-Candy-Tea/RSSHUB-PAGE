Developer Lancarse and publisher Square Enix have released a new trailer for its upcoming strategy RPG The DioField Chronicle. The trailer focuses on explaining various aspects of The DioField Chronicle‘s gameplay. Check it out below.
The DioField Chronicle will be a real-time strategy RPG. Described by the studio as a “simulation RPG”, the game revolves around the Blue Fox mercenaries trying to make a living in a world beset by war.
The core gameplay seems to have a bit of a focus on positional attacks, as gameplay snippets from various trailers have showcased characters doing extra damage from certain positions relative to their enemies, and even using unique abilities.
Details on The DioField Chronicle‘s collector’s edition were revealed in July. Available in standard and Digital Deluxe flavours, pre-ordering either edition will get players the Rhopasto Knife and Recruit’s Bangle. The Digital Deluxe edition includes the base game along with some in-game items, like the Knight’s Spear and Mystical Ring, along with a digital copy of the soundtrack and artbook.
The game will also feature a physical Collector’s Edition in limited quantities. Priced at $170, the Collector’s Edition features the standard edition, The DioField Chronicle Board Game, a Four Pins set, and the Collector’s Goods Box.
Just last month, The DioField Chronicle got another trailer announcing its release date. Set for launch on PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and Nintendo Switch, The DioField Chronicle is out on September 22.
