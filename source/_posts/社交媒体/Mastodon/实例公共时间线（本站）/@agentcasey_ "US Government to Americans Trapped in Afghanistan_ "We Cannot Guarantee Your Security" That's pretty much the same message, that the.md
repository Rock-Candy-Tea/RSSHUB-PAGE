<hr><p>U.S. Government to Americans Trapped in Afghanistan: "We Cannot Guarantee Your Security." That's pretty much the same message, that they're giving us, at home too, as well.

Also, who are these <a href="https://pawoo.net/tags/democrats" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#democrats</a> that are trapped in Afghanistan? Inquiring minds wish to know. <a href="https://is.gd/oFKAkN" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://is.gd/oFKAkN</a></p><br><img src="https://img.pawoo.net/media_attachments/files/038/245/818/original/55bd1579d2d051b3.jpg" alt="image " referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
