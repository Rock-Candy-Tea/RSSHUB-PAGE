<hr><p>Families and clinicians receive information from Private Autopsy Services about the cause of a relative's death. We need formal authorisation from the person who has the legal right to request an autopsy before we can perform one. The Pathologist will need to know whether there are any further limits or organs of interest prior to the autopsy.<br><a href="https://www.1800autopsy.com/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://www.1800autopsy.com/</a></p><br><img src="https://img.pawoo.net/media_attachments/files/041/877/592/original/90c1dff3b76c7459.jpg" alt="image " referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
