<hr><p>It's a good thing that the <a href="https://pawoo.net/tags/democrats" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#democrats</a> have perfected the ability to steal any and all elections, because if the last eight months have shown us anything, it's that, it's not just Biden that's useless, the US Generals and the "Intelligence" Agencies are too. Look it up. Yes, the deep-state is too busy worrying about spying on patriots, more than buying a clue. They know how to start and put up a fight but they just can't finish it to beat us. <a href="https://is.gd/K18Zxz" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://is.gd/K18Zxz</a></p><br><img src="https://img.pawoo.net/media_attachments/files/038/226/992/original/f4285a208bc3bf45.jpg" alt="image " referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
