<hr><p>Joe Biden's Air strike Killed An Innocent Family Of Nine. That's something anyone can believe, isn't it? You know, this senility thing might work out for Joe after all, that way, he'll have an excuse for being the worst president in a generation. Since <a href="https://pawoo.net/tags/democrats" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#democrats</a> don't believe in elections, because they can't win any, without cheating, they're probably into monarchies now, so I guess when Joe dies it'll be "president" Hunter, next. <a href="https://is.gd/T0fWxx" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://is.gd/T0fWxx</a></p><br><img src="https://img.pawoo.net/media_attachments/files/038/545/661/original/52eb46b5f3d76681.jpeg" alt="image " referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
