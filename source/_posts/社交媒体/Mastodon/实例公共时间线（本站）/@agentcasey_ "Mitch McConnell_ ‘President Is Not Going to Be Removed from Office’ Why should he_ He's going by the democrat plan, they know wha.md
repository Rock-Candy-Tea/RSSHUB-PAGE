<hr><p>Mitch McConnell: ‘President Is Not Going to Be Removed from Office.’ Why should he? He's going by the <a href="https://pawoo.net/tags/democrat" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#democrat</a> plan, they know what they're doing. Look, they're stealing elections, they don't have to report to us. You'll see it in California soon, the democrats will be on a winning streak forever. Imagine people actually deluded enough, to think that their votes matter. The guy is half dead anyway. Kamala will be our new king. <a href="https://is.gd/9LGdh5" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://is.gd/9LGdh5</a></p><br><img src="https://img.pawoo.net/media_attachments/files/038/578/448/original/bfcc66feaecc9108.jpg" alt="image " referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
