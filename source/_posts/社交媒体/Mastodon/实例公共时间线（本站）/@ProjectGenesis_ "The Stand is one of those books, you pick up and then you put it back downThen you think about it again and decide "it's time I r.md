<hr><p>The Stand is one of those books, you pick up and then you put it back down..Then you think about it again and decide "it's time I read this." It's one of those books I wanted to discuss on my blog, despite there is no explicit moments in it. Its still by far the best Graphic Novel I've read. I wish all the stories were about these two. But it wasn't..Now if Futa artist could write this damn good I'd read sex stories more, sadly I don't because they bore the shit out of me compared to this. <a href="https://pawoo.net/tags/art" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#art</a></p><br><img src="https://img.pawoo.net/media_attachments/files/037/530/432/original/45ec6954c387dba4.jpg" alt="image " referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><br><img src="https://img.pawoo.net/media_attachments/files/037/530/454/original/a943156450f97f3a.jpeg" alt="image " referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><br><img src="https://img.pawoo.net/media_attachments/files/037/530/455/original/3c2b8ca8af117926.jpg" alt="image " referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><br><img src="https://img.pawoo.net/media_attachments/files/037/530/459/original/f5a6c5aba2a09a20.jpg" alt="image " referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
