<hr><p>The last kernel freaked out because it was the wrong one. Instead of installing <a href="https://pawoo.net/tags/linux" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#linux</a>-raspberrypi4, I had installed linux-aarch64. That kernel booted up but flung me into the emergency shell. So not realizing that, I populated /boot with the contents of my <a href="https://pawoo.net/tags/Manjaro" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#Manjaro</a>-ARM kernel and put the corresponding modules into /lib/modules and booted up. I can stop that now everything is right with the world once again. I like Arch on the Pi, now I see what all the fuss is about, <a href="https://pawoo.net/tags/Arch" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#Arch</a> is nice.</p><br><img src="https://img.pawoo.net/media_attachments/files/039/667/502/original/3e5de7b4de48ab43.jpg" alt="image " referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
