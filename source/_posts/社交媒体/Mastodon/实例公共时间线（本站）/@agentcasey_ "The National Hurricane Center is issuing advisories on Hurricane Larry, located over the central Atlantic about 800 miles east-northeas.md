<hr><p>The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane Larry, located over the central Atlantic about 800 miles east-northeast of the northern Leeward Islands. For those who don't know, <a href="https://pawoo.net/tags/democrats" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#democrats</a> worldwide, are salivating at the prospect that hurricane Larry, will make a landing in Florida. They can't wait to have a narrative, of an incompetent Governor, Ron Desantis and his alleged, COVID woes. We hope for the best. <a href="https://is.gd/zyuonS" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://is.gd/zyuonS</a></p><br><img src="https://img.pawoo.net/media_attachments/files/038/672/236/original/372773dbc53306bf.png" alt="image " referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
