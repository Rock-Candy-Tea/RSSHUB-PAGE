<hr><p>Random cute shota art.  Enjoy!</p><p>First pic gives me a similar feeling like  Mitsui Jun, a playfulness similar to his fox & Tanuki/Raccoon Dog characters that have human forms. Always loved the way he drew stuff and the playfulness/silliness of it all.</p><p>Second one reminds me of this Amy Locker Room flash that Kami Nitro/Nitrotitan/Mode Seven/Minus8 did a while back. </p><p>For the third one: "When I said that I wanted a cocktail, this isn't exactly what I pictured in my head."<br> <a href="https://pawoo.net/tags/shota" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#shota</a> <a href="https://pawoo.net/tags/hentai" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#hentai</a> <a href="https://pawoo.net/tags/pee" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#pee</a></p><br><img src="https://img.pawoo.net/media_attachments/files/108/916/574/506/137/286/original/4b9fca0098c882f1.jpg" alt="image " referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><br><img src="https://img.pawoo.net/media_attachments/files/108/916/578/658/006/596/original/6a691365e1fa310b.jpg" alt="image " referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><br><img src="https://img.pawoo.net/media_attachments/files/108/916/627/448/175/880/original/368b02ce6d089bc5.jpg" alt="image " referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><br><img src="https://img.pawoo.net/media_attachments/files/108/916/627/948/960/889/original/825d4308bcd4c51f.jpg" alt="image " referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
