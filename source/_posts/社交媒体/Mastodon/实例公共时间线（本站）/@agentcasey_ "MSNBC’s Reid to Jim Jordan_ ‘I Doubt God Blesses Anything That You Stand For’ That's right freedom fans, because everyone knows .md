<hr><p>MSNBC’s Reid to Jim Jordan: ‘I Doubt God Blesses Anything That You Stand For.’ That's right <a href="https://pawoo.net/tags/freedom" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#freedom</a> fans, because everyone knows that God only looks after the <a href="https://pawoo.net/tags/communists" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#communists</a>, <a href="https://pawoo.net/tags/democrats" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#democrats</a> and people who escape their countries, to come to the US, so that they can insult us. I wasn't aware that the <a href="https://pawoo.net/tags/authoritarian" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#authoritarian</a> sponsoring, global press, had any gods other than, the climate change god and the one that they sacrifice aborted babies to. I imagine those Gods don't love us much. <a href="https://is.gd/ZSfkHO" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://is.gd/ZSfkHO</a></p><br><img src="https://img.pawoo.net/media_attachments/files/038/708/788/original/199e1de09b02e3b7.jpg" alt="image " referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
