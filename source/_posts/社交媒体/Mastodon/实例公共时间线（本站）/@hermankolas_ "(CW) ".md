<div>   
<hr><p>I was drawing some concept art for some of my favorite Disgaea characters in classes from various other game. Drawing Flonne as a Predator from Maiesta: The Gravid RPG seemed entertaining, and it doesn't seem entirely out of character since she is proficient with bows. I did sketch a covering for the lower half of her face, but I omitted it from the final image since it didn't look very good.</p><p><a href="https://pawoo.net/tags/disgaea" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#disgaea</a> <a href="https://pawoo.net/tags/flonne" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#flonne</a> <a href="https://pawoo.net/tags/vore" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#vore</a></p><br><img src="https://img.pawoo.net/media_attachments/files/040/123/758/original/3648fd6adf86757d.png" alt="image " referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
