<hr><p>The Nord 50W features a max power output of 50W giving you the flexibility to enjoy everything from an intensely satisfying MTL (mouth-to-lung) vape experience to a rich and airy DL (Direct Lung) sensation, depending upon the resistance of coil you use. This is powered by a long-lasting 1800mAh battery that can be charged in super-quick time thanks to the Nord 50W’s Type-C USB cable. The advanced chipset brings several safety protections that provide peace of mind.<br><a href="https://ukvaporwaves.com/smok-nord-50w-pod-kit.html" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://ukvaporwaves.com/smok-nord-50w-pod-kit.html</a></p><br><img src="https://img.pawoo.net/media_attachments/files/042/537/427/original/9d0db5e356b2ef9f.png" alt="image " referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
