<hr><p>Silver Haze (AAA)</p><p>Silver Haze is a heavily sativa dominant hybrid (90% sativa/10% indica) strain created by breeders at the infamous Sensi Seeds farms as a potent cross between the insanely popular Skunk #1 X Northern Lights #5 X Haze strains. This dank bud is a cult favorite among many cannabis users and boasts an average THC level ranging from 20-24%. Silver Haze gets its name from the intensely shiny THC glands covering its buds. </p><p><a href="https://www.greencounterclub.ca/product/silver-haze-aaa/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://www.greencounterclub.ca/product/silver-haze-aaa/</a></p><br><img src="https://img.pawoo.net/media_attachments/files/037/350/091/original/62a878ebe692ade5.jpg" alt="image " referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
