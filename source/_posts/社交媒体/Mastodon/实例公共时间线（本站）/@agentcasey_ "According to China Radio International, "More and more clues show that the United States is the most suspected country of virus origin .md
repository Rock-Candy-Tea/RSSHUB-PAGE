<hr><p>According to China Radio International, "More and more clues show that the United States is the most suspected country of virus origin that should be investigated by WHO." Maybe it's true. Perhaps the <a href="https://pawoo.net/tags/democrats" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#democrats</a> are the source of <a href="https://pawoo.net/tags/COVID" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#COVID</a>.

They're almost as good as CNN. <a href="http://www.cri.cn/i" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">http://www.cri.cn/i</a></p><br><img src="https://img.pawoo.net/media_attachments/files/037/973/437/original/40babf7685561d27.jpg" alt="image " referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
