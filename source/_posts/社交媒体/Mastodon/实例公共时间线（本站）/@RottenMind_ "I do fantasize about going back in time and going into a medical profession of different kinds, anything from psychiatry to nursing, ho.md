<hr><p>I do fantasize about going back in time and going into a medical profession of different kinds, anything from psychiatry to nursing, honestly. </p><p>It must be so empowering to have such knowledge of mind and/or body. Not to mention the inherent respect and trust people will have for you.</p><p>Imagine all the sick shit you could get away with when it comes to dealing with people under anesthesia or even the mentally ill... Whose going to believe them?</p><p>Do you have any medical fantasies? Please share. ♥</p><br><img src="https://img.pawoo.net/media_attachments/files/043/146/587/original/17018735c7ea569f.jpg" alt="image " referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
