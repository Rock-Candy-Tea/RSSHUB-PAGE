So much in that influenced the direction I took, but Shadow Hill is in fact a series of it's own. What that means is that it's not 100% like Silent Hill but about 60%.  Overall I enjoyed the video, I tried getting into the SH comics before and they just didn't feel anything like Silent Hill at all.  <a href="https://pawoo.net/tags/nsfw" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#nsfw</a> <a href="https://pawoo.net/tags/girl" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#girl</a> <a href="https://pawoo.net/tags/femdom" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#femdom</a> <a href="https://pawoo.net/tags/sex" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#sex</a> <a href="https://pawoo.net/tags/silenthill" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#silenthill</a></p><br><video src="https://img.pawoo.net/media_attachments/files/041/148/954/original/f21cfe1099bf866f.mp4" autoplay loop>gif </video>
