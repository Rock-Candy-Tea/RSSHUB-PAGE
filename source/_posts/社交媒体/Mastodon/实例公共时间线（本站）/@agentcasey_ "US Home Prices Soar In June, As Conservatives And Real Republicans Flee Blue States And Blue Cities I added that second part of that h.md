<hr><p>US Home Prices Soar In June, As Conservatives And Real Republicans Flee Blue States And Blue Cities. I added that second part of that headline and just translated the article too. You're welcome. Yes, Americans, the one's with our eyes wide open can't bear the stench of tyranny or that of <a href="https://pawoo.net/tags/democrats" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#democrats</a>, for that matter and are finding our fortunes elsewhere. Just until everyone realizes that <a href="https://pawoo.net/tags/democrats" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#democrats</a> will be cheating in every election from now on. Then all bets are off. <a href="https://is.gd/mNB35H" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://is.gd/mNB35H</a></p><br><img src="https://img.pawoo.net/media_attachments/files/038/549/107/original/697db76f2d8ae89e.jpg" alt="image " referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
