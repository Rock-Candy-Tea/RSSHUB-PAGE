I'm really shocked that I have to explain this. So, they do what they've always done, only win 16.7% of the 3,007 US counties, a record low and you wonder why your intelligence, your sanity and the election results of 2020 are in question? Who are your mental equals? <a href="https://pawoo.net/tags/stopthesteal" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#stopthesteal</a></p><br><img src="https://img.pawoo.net/media_attachments/files/036/382/224/original/ccccd9afc4322dd4.jpeg" alt="image " referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
