<hr><p>PICS: Gleeful Taliban Terrorists Enjoy Fairground Rides as American Freedoms Crumble. Spreading the love around. I just got my harassment mail from the IRS today, well at least they're not trying to kill us all off at once, just yet. I'm just loving all this freedom. What does the Taliban and the <a href="https://pawoo.net/tags/democrat" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#democrat</a> deep state have in common? Their love of total control. It's better to control one's self that to control a city. The war has begun and I've chosen my side. <a href="https://is.gd/INfVHv" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://is.gd/INfVHv</a></p><br><img src="https://img.pawoo.net/media_attachments/files/039/192/295/original/99d4fffd42d27f82.jpg" alt="image " referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
