<hr><p>‘F ** K Joe Biden’ Chants Break Out at College Football Games Nationwide. A trend I'm sure <a href="https://pawoo.net/tags/democrats" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#democrats</a> will not tolerate, once they have caught on, be on the lookout for random COVID related lockdowns at the nation's universities. It's good to see that the sentiment is catching on though. I wonder what has them so mad? I can't think of anything either. Luckily, for Biden and company if it spills over to the NFL, no one will be watching. <a href="https://is.gd/gD2QVb" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://is.gd/gD2QVb</a></p><br><img src="https://img.pawoo.net/media_attachments/files/038/726/554/original/846a4076e1d4193b.jpg" alt="image " referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
