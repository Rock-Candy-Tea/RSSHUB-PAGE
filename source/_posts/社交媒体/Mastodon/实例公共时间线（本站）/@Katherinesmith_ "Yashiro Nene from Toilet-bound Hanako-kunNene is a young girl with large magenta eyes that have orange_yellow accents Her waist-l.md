<hr><p>Yashiro Nene from Toilet-bound Hanako-kun<br>Nene is a young girl with large magenta eyes that have orange/yellow accents. Her waist-length hair is a light cream color, which gradually fades into a soft teal green at the tips and is styled with baby bangs at her forehead. She wears two dark brown magatama hair accessories on the side of her head, which pulls back some of her hair. Occasionally, Nene wears other hairstyles such as braids, ponytails, and twintails. <a href="https://pawoo.net/tags/yashironene" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#yashironene</a> <a href="https://pawoo.net/tags/toiletboundhanakokun" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#toiletboundhanakokun</a></p><br><img src="https://img.pawoo.net/media_attachments/files/040/281/887/original/d7e0bc12e638d14c.png" alt="image " referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
