I'm using the Manjaro Linux kernel for now since the stock kernel, 5.14.13-1-ARCH, wouldn't load the USB devices and therefore, couldn't find the root device. I'll figure out a more elegant solution once I'm finished kicking the tires over here, it's as much fun as <a href="https://pawoo.net/tags/Debian" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#Debian</a>.</p><br><img src="https://img.pawoo.net/media_attachments/files/039/649/605/original/bc9393ec8962537d.jpg" alt="image " referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
