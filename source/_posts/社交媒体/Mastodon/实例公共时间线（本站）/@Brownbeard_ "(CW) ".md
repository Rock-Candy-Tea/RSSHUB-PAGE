<hr><p>Who wouldn't love to drive through a school district and snatch as many pretty young things as they could?</p><p>Van/snatch kidnappings are always such a magical moment for both parties involved.</p><p>For the kidnapper it's the amazing thrill of a hunter capturing their meek prey.</p><p>For the child, it's the moment their whole life's purpose and destiny changes beyond their control.
