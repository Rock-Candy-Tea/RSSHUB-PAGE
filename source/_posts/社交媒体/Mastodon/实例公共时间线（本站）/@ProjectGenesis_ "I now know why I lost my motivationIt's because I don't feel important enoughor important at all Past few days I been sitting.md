<hr><p>I now know why I lost my motivation...It's because I don't feel important enough..or important at all. Past few days I been sitting here building characters, and wondering whether or not this Shadow Hill 2 project is going to make me a greater success..So much thought processing has already gone into it...But at the same time. I'm kind of worried and just concerned overall about my future..Most days I'm unhappy as hell, when I get all too emotional I abuse medication or just angry and bitter..</p><br><img src="https://img.pawoo.net/media_attachments/files/036/636/216/original/69279cc80e2f5e22.jpg" alt="image " referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
