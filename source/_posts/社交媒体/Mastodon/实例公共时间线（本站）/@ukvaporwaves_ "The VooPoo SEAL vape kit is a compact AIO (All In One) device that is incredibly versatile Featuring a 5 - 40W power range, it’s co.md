<hr><p>The VooPoo SEAL vape kit is a compact AIO (All In One) device that is incredibly versatile. Featuring a 5 - 40W power range, it’s compatible with the ever-popular VooPoo PnP coils that give you the option to use this kit for MTL (Mouth To Lung) or DTL (Direct To Lung) vaping. Thanks to the 1200mAh built-in battery you’ll experience more vaping between charges and up to a day’s worth of use when fully charged.
