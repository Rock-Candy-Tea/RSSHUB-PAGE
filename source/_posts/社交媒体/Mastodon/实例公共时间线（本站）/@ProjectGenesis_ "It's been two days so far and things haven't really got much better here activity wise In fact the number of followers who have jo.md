<hr><p>It's been two days so far and things haven't really got much better here activity wise. In fact the number of followers who have joined has dwindled quite a bit at the start of the month. Pawoo in general has seen a massive decline in activity in the local portion of the site while the federated section remains alive. Of course if people leave the T.D.E.F.E., I wont be offended. I have honestly been in a very rotten and disturbed mood as of lately, so I can't even concentrate.</p><br><img src="https://img.pawoo.net/media_attachments/files/042/905/002/original/efd8522c667de8bd.jpeg" alt="image " referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
