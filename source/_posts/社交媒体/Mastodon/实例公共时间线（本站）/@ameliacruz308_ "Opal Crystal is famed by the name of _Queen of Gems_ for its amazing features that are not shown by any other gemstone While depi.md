<hr><p>Opal Crystal is famed by the name of “Queen of Gems” for its amazing features that are not shown by any other gemstone. While depicting every color of a rainbow in a single gaze, it leaves your heart pounding with its beauty. It ranges around 5.5-6 on the Mohs scale of hardness that makes it quite delicate to handle. Yet, with optimum care it can sustain for generations with the same bling.</p><p>Visit Now :- <a href="https://lnkd.in/dQabdTxX" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://lnkd.in/dQabdTxX</a></p><br><img src="https://img.pawoo.net/media_attachments/files/108/327/780/974/744/362/original/4bb42cab2ee28cc8.jpg" alt="image " referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
