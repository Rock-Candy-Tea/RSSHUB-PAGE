<hr><p>While Fakebook contemplates a name change, in the hearts and minds of several million Americans and probably, many millions elsewhere, their name is already, a settled fact. Only the very woke have any affiliations with them anymore and it seems that Zuck and company can't pay them enough to stay. The writing on the wall is also getting clearer for WokeTube as well. We'll bring them to their knees faster than Kamala Harris at a job interview, allegedly.</p><br><img src="https://img.pawoo.net/media_attachments/files/039/668/771/original/6a88e7dc130b9041.jpg" alt="image " referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
