rant and ramblings, semi-hornypost<hr><p>But let's horny post a bit here to prove my point:</p><p>If you're masturbating to drawings of a little girl spread eagle sucking some hot sperm out of daddy's dick, and you're wondering what that pink child slit would smell and taste like, and thinking "I wish that was me."<br>Well...  ðŸ˜‰ </p><p>Some Western communities and forums literally ban terms like "little girl" and ask users to use "loli" instead. They are aware of the importance of Language itself.</p><p>4/n</p><br><img src="https://img.pawoo.net/media_attachments/files/108/498/092/858/471/457/original/b3bac0ff3cedfe04.png" alt="image " referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
