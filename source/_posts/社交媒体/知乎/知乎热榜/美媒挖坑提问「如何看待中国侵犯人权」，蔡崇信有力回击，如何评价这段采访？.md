任幻想的回答<br><br><p>谢邀</p><p>蔡崇信一直是这样温文儒雅，有理有利有节。</p><p>建议各位都可以读一读19年莫雷推特事件后，蔡崇信写的公开信，把一切都梳理得井井有条，然后用外国人看得懂的话术，说给他们听：为什么分裂行为触犯了中国底线，中国人为什么愤怒。 ​​</p><p><br></p><p>致所有NBA球迷的公开信:</p><p>当我在9月份买下布鲁克林篮网队的控股权时，我并没有想到我与球迷的第一次公开交流，会是对这样一件充满政治色彩、被严重误解的事情发表评论，就像数百万中国NBA球迷对此事的看法一样。</p><p><br></p><p>到目前为止，你已经听说中国球迷对休斯顿火箭队总经理达里尔·莫雷支持香港抗议活动的一条推特做出了非常负面的反应。</p><p><br></p><p>到目前为止，火箭队一直是中国最受欢迎的球队，但现在，随着球迷们对火箭队的热爱、电视台拒绝转播比赛、中国企业纷纷取消赞助，火箭队实际上已经被挡在了中国市场之外。</p><p><br></p><p>中国球迷要求得到一个解释——如果他们没有从休斯顿火箭队得到这个解释，他们就会找NBA。</p><p><br></p><p>NBA一向把球迷摆在第一位，现在几亿球迷都因此事而愤怒，那NBA圈内的任何人都应该注意起来。作为董事会成员，以及一位在中国创业的华人，我必须发出自己的声音。</p><p><br></p><p>自由表达观点有什么问题？这是美国和NBA倡导的进步派价值观，但问题在于，在一些国家和社会中，很多事情是处于敏感范畴的。</p><p><br></p><p>支持分离主义，在中国就是敏感问题。不仅政府敏感，人民对此也非常敏感。</p><p><br></p><p>被很多西方媒体误会乃至忽视的，是中国14亿人民对于主权领土完整的重视，这一议题是没有商榷余地的。</p><p><br></p><p>这里需要向你们科普一下中国的历史知识。在19世纪中期，英法侵略者向中国输入鸦片，导致两场战争。清王朝战败，香港就此成为英国殖民地。</p><p><br></p><p>因为国土沦丧的耻辱，19世纪末才爆发了农民领导的义和团运动，结果引来八国联军的侵犯，连清王朝首都所在地北平（现在的北京）都被割据。</p><p><br></p><p>1937年，日本侵略中国，占据北京、上海、南京等地，犯下屠杀罪行。等到美国因珍珠港事件参战时，中国人为了抗击侵略者，已经付出了千万条生命。</p><p><br></p><p>我之所以讲这些历史，是希望你们明白为什么中国人民如此警惕外国分裂势力。对于香港问题，中国人民感受到的情绪，就是多年前被侵略者羞辱而产生的愤怒。</p><p><br></p><p>现在我希望你们西方人能理解为什么莫雷激起了如此大的民愤。我个人并不认识莫雷，我知道他作为总经理能力很强，他说自己对香港问题并不是真的了解，我就算他是在道歉了。但他给中国球迷造成的伤害，是需要很长时间才能弥补的。</p><p><br></p><p>我希望能帮助联盟度过莫雷制造的难关，作为董事，我也会继续就中国问题发表自己的见解。我也请求中国的球迷，给NBA一些信心，篮球一定可以让这个世界更团结。</p><p><br></p><p>蔡崇信</p><p><br></p><p>英文原文：</p><p>Open letter to all NBA fans: </p><p><br></p><p>When I bought controlling interest in the Brooklyn Nets in September, I didn’t expect my first public communication with our fans would be to comment on something as politically charged and grossly misunderstood as the way hundreds of millions of Chinese NBA fans feel about what just happened.</p><p><br></p><p>By now you have heard that Chinese fans have reacted extremely negatively to a tweet put out by Houston Rockets GM Daryl Morey in support of protests in Hong Kong. </p><p><br></p><p>The Rockets, who by far had been the favorite team in China, are now effectively shut out of the Chinese market as fans abandon their love for the team, broadcasters refuse to air their games and Chinese corporates pull sponsorships in droves.  </p><p><br></p><p>Fans in China are calling for an explanation – if they are not getting it from the Houston Rockets, then it is natural that they ask others associated with the NBA to express a view.</p><p><br></p><p>The NBA is a fan-first league. When hundreds of millions of fans are furious over an issue, the league, and anyone associated with the NBA, will have to pay attention.  As a Governor of one of the 30 NBA teams, and a Chinese having spent a good part of my professional life in China, I need to speak up.</p><p><br></p><p>What is the problem with people freely expressing their opinion? This freedom is an inherent American value and the NBA has been very progressive in allowing players and other constituents a platform to speak out on issues.  </p><p><br></p><p>The problem is, there are certain topics that are third-rail issues in certain countries, societies and communities. </p><p><br></p><p>Supporting a separatist movement in a Chinese territory is one of those third-rail issues, not only for the Chinese government, but also for all citizens in China. </p><p><br></p><p>The one thing that is terribly misunderstood, and often ignored, by the western press and those critical of China is that 1.4 billion Chinese citizens stand united when it comes to the territorial integrity of China and the country’s sovereignty over her homeland. This issue is non-negotiable.</p><p><br></p><p>A bit of historical perspective is important.  In the mid-19thcentury, China fought two Opium Wars with the British, aided by the French, who forced through illegal trade of opium to China. A very weak Qing Dynasty government lost the wars and the result was the ceding of Hong Kong to the British as a colony. </p><p><br></p><p>The invasion of Chinese territories by foreign forces continued against a weak and defenseless Qing government, which precipitated in the Boxer Rebellion by Chinese peasants at the turn of the 20th century. In response, the Eight Nations Alliance – comprised of Japan, Russia, Britain, France, United States, Germany, Italy and Austria-Hungary – dispatched their forces to occupy Chinese territories in the name of humanitarian intervention. The foreign forces marched into the Chinese capital Peking (now called Beijing), defeated the peasant rebels and proceeded to loot and pillage the capital city. </p><p><br></p><p>In 1937, Japan invaded China by capturing Beijing, Shanghai and the then-Chinese capital Nanjing.  Imperial Japanese troops committed mass murder and rape against the residents of Nanjing, resulting in several hundred thousand civilian deaths. The war of resistance by the Chinese against Japan ended after tens of millions of Chinese casualties, and only after America joined the war against Japan post-Pearl Harbor.</p><p><br></p><p>I am going into all of this because a student of history will understand that the Chinese psyche has heavy baggage when it comes to any threat, foreign or domestic, to carve up Chinese territories. </p><p><br></p><p>When the topic of any separatist movement comes up, Chinese people feel a strong sense of shame and anger because of this history of foreign occupation.  </p><p><br></p><p>By now I hope you can begin to understand why the Daryl Morey tweet is so damaging to the relationship with our fans in China.  I don’t know Daryl personally. I am sure he’s a fine NBA general manager, and I will take at face value his subsequent apology that he was not as well informed as he should have been.  But the hurt that this incident has caused will take a long time to repair.  </p><p><br></p><p>I hope to help the League to move on from this incident. I will continue to be an outspoken NBA Governor on issues that are important to China. I ask that our Chinese fans keep the faith in what the NBA and basketball can do to unite people from all over the world. </p><p><br></p><p>Sincerely,</p><p>Joe Tsai</p>
