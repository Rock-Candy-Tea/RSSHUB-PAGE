Beijing claims <br>such a visit is now unacceptable. They claim that things have changed. <br>Well, it is certainly true China has stepped up its aggressive actions. <br>They are trying to change the status quo through force. They have <br>expanded militarily in the South China Sea. They have invested in anti-<br>ship and anti-aircraft capabilities to threaten U.S. vessels. They have <br>manipulated and threatened neighbors and mounted an all-out assault on <br>democracy and autonomy in Hong Kong.<br>  Now Beijing wants to dictate Taiwan's future to its people and snuff <br>out the island's democracy, and they are building the military capacity <br>to actually bring that about. That is what is provocative. And to hear <br>those responsible for this aggression complain--complain--that Speaker <br>Pelosi's travel itinerary is provocative is utterly absurd.<br>  So I welcome the Speaker's display of support for Taiwan's democracy, <br>but I hope she returns from Asia more mindful of the military <br>dimensions of the Chinese threat and more committed to working with <br>Republicans to address the changing balance of military power in the <br>region. What that requires is selling the right mix of weapons to <br>Taiwan on a prompt timeline, while helping Taiwan's military prepare <br>for likely threats.<br>  The Biden administration has had 2 years to build on the robust <br>investments their immediate predecessors made in military <br>modernization. Instead, they submitted defense budget requests that <br>pointed in the completely wrong direction. While China keeps ramping <br>up, the Biden administration proposed to actually cut--cut--our defense <br>spending after inflation.<br>  So when Congress debates the Defense authorization and appropriations <br>bills, we must address national security challenges in the Indo-Pacific <br>head-on. And I hope the Speaker's travels will mean that we do so with <br>more of a bipartisan consensus on American might than we have seen in <br>the recent past.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></blockquote><p data-pid="uH_eVJQU">我就不全文翻译了，这老狐狸做为共和党领袖，支持民主党妖婆子窜访，这已经充分表明了美国两党在这件事情上是有充分共识的。</p><p data-pid="eRpcPBdK">老狐狸说：I believe she has every right to go</p><p data-pid="GiV830sC">这是啥意思，就是举双手双脚赞成妖婆子窜访台湾！</p><p data-pid="DX72WSTS">正是在这种背景下，我方必须反复就这个窜访事件向美方提出严正交涉，因为这种喊话，并不仅仅是针对拜登政府，而是对美国整个政治构架中的所有反华政客的警告。</p><p data-pid="o1wwtMGz">我真是tm越看越气。。。。。。</p><p></p><p></p><p></p>
