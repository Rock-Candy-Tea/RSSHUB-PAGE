It is really my privilege to be here and delighted to obtain this opportunity to attend this interview. I come from ××× Province, which is located in ××× part of China. I enjoy reading primarily because it can cultivate my critical thinking, diversify my knowledge and enrich my mind.<br>I graduated from ××× University, majored in ×××. Recalling my four-year college study, diligence and devotion are two keywords. I seldom idle away the precious time, get up at six o’clock every morning, collect materials in the library every weekend, and read manifold books at vacation. Academically, my GPA is 3.6 which ranks second in the grade. I passed CET6 in one attempt in my freshman year, and I have won the National Encouragement scholarship. Following my teacher Professor Zhao, I was so lucky to be responsible for basic collection, collation and review of relevant data in her research group, which inspired the genuine academic passion in my heart. <br>I am a patient and diligent girl, because I know good things take time and I believe if a person is not born to be intelligent, at least he must make sure he is diligent. That is the key to my further study in the future. I also believe the significance of solitude, without it, a student can not go further in the academic world.<br><br></blockquote><p data-pid="yUAvyzBn">【<b>关于家乡</b>】（以我自己为例）</p><blockquote data-pid="rlvOJWNG">My hometown is located in the northern part of China. It stands beside Song Hua River and abundant in rice and bean. It is a small city with honest and kind-hearted people. The most unique characteristic of my hometown is the apparent four seasons, especially the white snow and clear ice in winter. If you get a chance to come here, it's my pleasure to be your guide.</blockquote><p data-pid="86j2pgCE">【<b>关于兴趣爱好</b>】 </p><blockquote data-pid="VCaRYqUA"><u>读书</u>（自我介绍里有） <br><u>听音乐</u>：I am fond of music mainly because it can cheer me up greatly when I feel down. Besides I also believe that music is an indispensable part of culture through which I could have a better understanding of different cultures. My favorite English song is “speechless”, sang by Naomi Scott. The lyrics of ”I will take these broken wings and watch me burn across the sky. And hear the echoes saying I won’t be silenced." definitely spread strong power to me.<br></blockquote><p data-pid="iE-Maju3">【<b>优缺点</b>】</p><blockquote data-pid="t9bzaQHG"><u>Strength</u>: I also have a remarkable endurance. I can stand a long-time reading and researching work. Without a strong endurance, a student can not bear the solitude and boredom, therefore will not go further in the academic world.<br><u>Weakness</u>: In terms of my weakness, I am not good at relieving my pressure, which derives from my high requirements about myself. I allow no more leisure in my life, so sometimes I felt tied physically and mentally. Last month, I read some books to learn some hints to make a better balance between study and rest. But actually to be an outstanding person, you must stand up with some unbearable pressure. No achievement is obtained in leisure and pleasure.<br></blockquote><p data-pid="hORUeMDZ"><b>⭕PART TWO 关于考研</b></p><p data-pid="JAxeziau"><b>【为什么选择这个学校？（Why did you choose our university?）</b>】</p><blockquote data-pid="l0tvo1QT">（<u>讲故事</u>）All the good impression of our university came from my friend ×××. He succeeded in the postgraduate examination in the last year and became a new member here. He used to be an lazy person. He seldom read books and went to library, but spent at least 5 hours per day on playing games. So when he decided to prepare postgraduate exam, no one believe he can make it. He just told me, “SWUFE is always my dream , and I will do what I can to realize it.” And finally he made it. After that he totally changed into another person. Go to library every day and read books there at least 6 hours. He tells me now he will further study after graduation, heading for Doctor’s degree. I saw the profound influence and the significance of education of your university from my friend's experience. <br>A good university does not only pour specific knowledge into the students' mind, but also plant a seed in their hearts, which will inspire them to be a better man physically, mentally, academically and spiritually. That is the reason why I choose our university. In the last year, it was my friend's dream, but now it is mine.<br></blockquote><p><br></p><blockquote data-pid="Rv4R8oJ6"><u>（学校好）</u>XXX university is a really prestigious institute with a long history, good reputation and rigorous academic atmosphere. The first time I get to know our university is in my freshmen stage. I read an thesis from Professor Sun, （最好加上论文的标题）inspired and enlightened by her unique and creative viewpoints. So I have a strong faith and desire to continue my postgraduate study here, acquire further knowledge and to be a better self not only academically, but also comprehensively. The most important thing in the world, is not where we are, but which direction we are moving in.</blockquote><p data-pid="z9IiD-kn">【<b>你认为你的学校怎么样？(What do you think of your university ? )</b>】</p><blockquote data-pid="TxQMtQFj">I really love my university. It gave me the initial courage to begin my college life. The perfect patience of my teachers comfort my study anxiety, the diligence of my roommates motivated me to devote more energy into study. 4 years, 48 months, and 1460 days has witnessed my reshaping there. <br>My university is not in the leading position in academic field, but it has taught me how to be an academic person. That is always stand on the solid ground, and always do the solid research work.<br></blockquote><p data-pid="PkwMNVla">【<b>为什么想成为研究生？(Why do you want to be a postgraduate ?) </b>】</p><blockquote data-pid="SyA0p7gR">I'm looking forward to be a postgraduate as an opportunity to maintain the patience and diligence that have meant the most to me, continue to test the limits of myself with which my potential energy increases, and fearlessly explore the unknown life territory whose supreme beauty eludes most living souls. <br>To be a postgraduate student really means a lot to me, which is the result of long-term effort of day and night, the persistence of never-giving-up, the excitement of getting to know the score, and the deep understanding of my pursuit. Maybe I am not qualified enough now, but every master grows up from a beginner, and every long journey begins with a single step. (If I fail finally, I will never regret, because regret could not grow in a devoted heart. )<br></blockquote><p data-pid="5QtNZvnt">⭕<b>PART THREE 关于专业</b></p><p data-pid="R48Ss0rI">【<b>为什么选择这个专业？（Why do you choose this major?）</b>】 </p><blockquote data-pid="oz0RqYGH">Interest is the best teacher. At the first class in the freshmen, I was attracted by _____ （ 专 业 的 名 词 ） ， which spread out a charming map before me. In this map, I am exposed to the world of A, B, and C (专 业名词定义）. They all bring me enormous passion to make a deep exploration in this field. In the past preparation year, ___ and ___ have became my major interest orientation. The theory of ____ made me realize only by academic insight can you come into its fantastic world. So I choose it only for my own interest and passion rather than the consideration of future career. Benjamin Franklin ever said, “ An investment in knowledge pays the best interest.” I totally agree with it. To be a postgraduate, the main focus on knowledge and the constant passion on major should be the basic guides.</blockquote><p data-pid="NYlGOSug">【<b>在你的专业研究领域过去 5 年里最重要的改变？（What do you think have been the most important changes in your study field over the past 5 years?）</b>】</p><blockquote data-pid="cxgAhvy9">In the past 5 years, a lot of researchers have put forward xxx theoryin our research field, which has totally changed or enriched the previous theory system in that area. In 2015, Professor A’s theory ______ , filled the blank of ___ field. Two years later, Professor B from _____ proposed ______ the theory of ____, which aroused the great controversy. <br>That is the interesting point of academic study. It seems like there is no absolute right answer, which brings more space for the young man like me to imagine, explore and discover. <br></blockquote><p data-pid="I6wg31sS">【<b>研究生学习计划？（What’s your study plan if you are accepted as a postgraduate student? ） </b>】</p><blockquote data-pid="YTghee6G"><u>（版 本一）</u>I will make my study arrangement according to the semesters. The first semester is the best time to build the theory foundation, so I will devote all time to read at least 20 books, attend various kind of lectures or seminars, and assist my supervisor to do some detailed work in the programme. I will make full use of the second semester to begin my thesis writing and meanwhile confirm the research field with the guidance of my supervisor. Half year will be spent to write the graduation paper and my basic principle is the earlier, the better. <br>Plan was just what I imagined according to my current cognition, maybe not reasonable and practical, but I always hold the belief that action speaks louder than words. A qualified postgraduate studentshould act before he speaks and afterwards speaks according to his action. <br></blockquote><p><br></p><blockquote data-pid="qbzSIIn0"><u>（版本二）</u>At the first semester, I will try to attain a professional certification, which can demonstrate that I have proficiency. I will take part in some relevant internships to improve my translation and interpretation skills. <br>Different lectures can also provide the theoretical knowledge, and I believe I will obtain more unexpected things from the experienced speaker's lectures. In a word, the combination of theory and practice is really vital to a translator, and I will stick to this principle to keep practicing regardless of any obstacles and difficulties.<br></blockquote><p data-pid="amij5LwR">⭕<b>其他问答</b></p><p data-pid="Ay4xPCJG"><b>【除了专业课书籍，最喜欢哪本书？Besides your major books, which book do you like most? 】</b></p><p data-pid="knr_SoZe"><u>回答要点：书名、作者、创作背景、核心观点、对人的影响</u></p><blockquote data-pid="DYdFWNxi">When it comes to the book I like most, I guess it is Walden written by Henry David Thoreau. Thoreau is best known for his book Walden, a reflection upon simple living in natural surroundings. The book was written in the middle of the 19th century when the capitalism experienced a rapid development and when most people pursued at their utmost to obtain higher social statues and money. <br>To experience the pure life in nature, he carried an axe and ran into the uninhabited Walden at the edge of the mountain forest and settled down over here. He wrote down what he thought and what he experienced in Walden, encouraging people to simplify the life and go deep into the inner heart. <br>It is a book about man, what he is and what he should be and must be. Thoreau has faith in the inner virtue and inward spiritual grace of man. He hold the most important thing for men to do with their lives is to be self-sufficient and strive to achieve personal spiritual perfection.<br>Walden is not written to instruct, but to inspire. Through the reading of it, I may see that there are still several more lives to live. <br><br><br></blockquote><p data-pid="A3FqKzoE">【<b> Do you like having a busy life? Why or why not?】</b></p><blockquote data-pid="UGnhGcjM">Yes, I like a busy life. I prefer to be busy since I am young and energetic. To be a young man, it is more effective to do something meaningful rather than staying at dormitory or lazing around. If I spend too much time at leisure or neglect my study, life will become monotonous and uninteresting, while making full use of time, I am sure, will bring me  a fruitful reward.</blockquote><p data-pid="6uYWJP5o"><b>【Have you experienced stress at study? How do you handle it?  】</b></p><blockquote data-pid="FsT04adU">Definitely I have experienced stress at study in certain situations. For instance, when I am asked to challenge a difficult task, I will be very anxious and stressful. In order to handle the situation, I make a feasible plan for completing the task and try to do a little bit everyday to make the overall workload feel smaller.</blockquote><p data-pid="Tuiwe67Q"><b>【What would you do if you lost the chance to be a postgraduate student? 】 </b></p><blockquote data-pid="cFWTUpPO">I will choose to restart my journey to postgraduate exam. Because to be a postgraduate student of XX university is my long-term dream, and difficulty and failure could not take my courage away. Through the preparation of last whole year, I have understood my deficient parts and grasp the key to improvement. I can accept failure, everyone fails at something. But I can't accept not trying.</blockquote><p data-pid="ifkq68yN">【<b> 观点类：Do you think advertising plays an important role in today's society?  Why or why not? 】</b></p><p data-pid="MvWTPFIV"><u>回答观点类的问题：①一定要有很明确的观点，不能模棱两可，什么都好；②理由一般来说给两个，时间很紧一个也可以；③最后要有一句总结的话来收尾，不能说不下去了就立刻结束。</u></p><blockquote data-pid="YV8nk6C8">Certainly, advertising plays an essential role in society because it is everywhere. Wherever we look, we can see it in the newspapers, magazines, television, the Internet even public transportation. Additionally, we live in a consumer-based society and people need to  purchase goods to keep the economy growing. Therefore, advertising is a way to promote economic development and ensure that there is appropriate competition between firms.</blockquote><p data-pid="nuJPilfb"><b>【How can you help yourself concentrate when you’re studying for a  long time？Why?  】</b></p><blockquote data-pid="n4L9mCd-">If I need to study for a whole day, as time progresses, it becomes challenging to focus on my study. I have realized that taking regular breaks during study periods is essential for boosting concentration. Additionally, a short nap will allow my mind to feel refreshed and  sharpened in order to pay attention to my studies.</blockquote><p data-pid="HiqS7hhe"><b>【Do you find it easier to concentrate on study in the morning or in the evening?】 </b></p><blockquote data-pid="CZBfzl1R">For me, it is easier to study in the evenings when the environment is quiet and peaceful. Furthermore, I can focus well on my study without any distractions from roommates or family members. My room is also dark and free of sunlight at this time, allowing me to turn on my desk lamp to work on my studies.</blockquote><p data-pid="2C4HrDbr"><b>【Do you work better when the room is silent or when there is some noise? 】 </b></p><blockquote data-pid="uoW4JUiM">I tend to work more effectively when the room is silent since I can focus on what I need to do. If there is noise, it will be quite distracting and difficult for me to concentrate on the task at hand. Furthermore, silence can enable me to think more efficiently and fluidly rather than worrying about disturbances.</blockquote><p data-pid="W0xOTC1X">3. 掌握<u>口语对话中必备“口头语”</u>，可以让英语听起来没那么中式化。</p><p data-pid="mBNunu5f">⭕未听清，再次询问，<b>要求重复</b>时：</p><ul><li data-pid="eNnlBKCA"> I'm afraid of I'm not quite clear about… </li><li data-pid="Uw_f8R6R">I'm afraid I didn't quite catch you. </li><li data-pid="i4M9mCE2">Would you like to repeat the question? </li><li data-pid="pnbGvskK">Excuse me.
