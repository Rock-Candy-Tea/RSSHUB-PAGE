However, Chinese private space company Spacety released HISEA-1 radar satellite imagery of Melitopol Air Base, dated 24 Feb 2022: the day of the invasion, the day before the evacuation of the Il-76s. Because it is radar imagery, cloud cover is not a problem.</p><p data-pid="6ttXfEvH">On radar imagery, smooth objects show up as dark (weak backscatter) while rough objects show up as bright (strong backscatter). Pavement and intact aircraft fuselages therefore show up dark. Rough(er) surfaces, such as vegetation and aircraft wreckages, appear brighter.</p><p><br></p><p data-pid="ds8YHKfb">The imagery shows one very bright and clear aircraft at Melitopol Air Base: A wrecked Ilyushin Il-76MD, later identified as Il-76MD reg. 76697 (MSN: 00634 70118). Last seen active on 17 Feb 2022, she was airworthy until the incident, and was therefore a valuable asset of Ukraine Air Force</p><p><br></p><p data-pid="eW_Zq7oK">The fact the events took place in this order is a major discovery: when pictures of the two wrecked Il-76s (the other being <span class="nolink">76322</span>, MSN: 00534 62873, in long term storage) were first released in early April 2022, general belief was that they had been <span class="nolink">unable to get away</span> before Russia captured the base on 01 Mar 2022.

Not seen using Mode-S transponders until close to the border, they sneak out at low altitude, in a suspected attempt to remain unnoticed by Russian radar systems until reaching the border.
