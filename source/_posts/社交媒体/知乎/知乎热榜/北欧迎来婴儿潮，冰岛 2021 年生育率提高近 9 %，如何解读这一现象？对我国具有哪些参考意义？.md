But it’s not without precedent. Demographers have twice observed birth trends go against the economic cycle in the Nordic countries.<br>In the 1990s, Finland suffered a devastating recession when financial mismanagement and the collapse of the Soviet Union sent the unemployment rate sky-high. But births increased 2.3 percent between 1989 and 1993, Nisén says.<br>More recently, Iceland was one of the worst-hit economies in the world in the aftermath of the Great Recession in 2008, when approximately 90 percent of the country’s economy collapsed. Yet births went up sharply. “Crisis seems to be the time when Icelanders increase their fertility,” says Anton Örn Karlsson, the head of demography at Iceland’s national statistics team.<br><br></blockquote><p data-pid="0tlIvDjF">原文里给的解释是，对北欧国家而言，经济越差，生育率越高。可能和当地的育儿补贴有关。经济差的时候，育儿补贴是一项不小的经济来源。</p><blockquote data-pid="KbSsu4A2">A leading hypothesis on why this might be is that in times of economic uncertainty, the Nordic countries’ generous family leave pay helps alleviate concerns about increased financial burden. A new baby can act as a financial security net for the household.</blockquote><p data-pid="-5rRKpK8"></p>
