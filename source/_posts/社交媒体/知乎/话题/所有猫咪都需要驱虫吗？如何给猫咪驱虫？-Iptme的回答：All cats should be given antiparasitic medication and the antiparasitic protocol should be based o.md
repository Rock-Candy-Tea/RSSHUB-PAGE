<strong>所有猫咪都需要驱虫吗？如何给猫咪驱虫？</strong><br>Iptme的回答<br><p data-pid="-k3sPu1Y">All cats should be given antiparasitic medication and the antiparasitic protocol should be based on the results of the cat's parasite test. </p><p data-pid="hZvoosHH">Piperazine<br>This over-the-counter dewormer kills roundworms in cats. It's available in pills, pastes and liquid versions, either mixed with food or put directly in Kitty's mouth. It's safe for pregnant cats, but don't give it to kittens under 6 weeks old. Ask your vet before giving piperazine to sick cats or those with compromised immune systems. Don't give it to cats with liver or kidney disease.</p><p data-pid="VKa3XVdE">Praziquantel<br>If Kitty has tapeworms, praziquantel, available in tablets over the counter, can get rid of them. One or two treatments might be needed to complete the deed. Since cats get tapeworms from fleas, you should use praziquantel in conjunction with effective flea control, such as a topical monthly flea medication. Your vet can give Kitty a praziquantel injection.</p><p data-pid="8qSYhLSQ">Pyrantel Pamoate<br>Pyrantel pamoate doesn't actually kill roundworms, but it paralyzes them so the little critters lose their grip on Kitty's intestine and end up eliminated in his feces. It also gets rid of hookworms. A prescription version combined with praziquantel and other anthelmintics is called Drontal. While pyrantel pamoate is safe for kittens and pregnant and lactating cats, don't combine it with piperazine.</p><p data-pid="cpOwx6Jb">Selamectin<br>Selamectin, a topical flea medication sold under the brand name Revolution, also keeps Kitty safe from heartworm, hookworm, roundworms and ear mites. It's available only by veterinary prescription.</p><p data-pid="ltvyQ927">Ivermectin<br>Also used to treat hookworm and prevent heartburn, ivermectin for felines is available by prescription under names, such as Heartgard and Heartgard Plus. Before giving you a prescription, the vet will test your cat for the presence of heartworms. If she's heartworm negative, she should be good to go. Give kitty this oral medication every month for roundworm eradication. Ivermectin also gets rid of certain skin parasites.</p><p data-pid="tlR4hKhM">Other Medications If Kitty has the intestinal parasite giardia, your vet might prescribe the drug metronidazole. Another treatment is the anthelmentic fenbendazole, available over the counter. For coccidiosis, your vet might give Kitty trimethoprim-sulfa for approximately six days to rid him of this organism.</p>
