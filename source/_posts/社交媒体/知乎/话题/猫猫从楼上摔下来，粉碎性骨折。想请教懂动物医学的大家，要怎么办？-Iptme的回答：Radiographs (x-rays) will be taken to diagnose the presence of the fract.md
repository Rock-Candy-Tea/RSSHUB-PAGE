<strong>猫猫从楼上摔下来，粉碎性骨折。想请教懂动物医学的大家，要怎么办？</strong><br>Iptme的回答<br><p data-pid="1d8Ydqsz">Radiographs (x-rays) will be taken to diagnose the presence of the fracture. Chest x-rays may be obtained at the same time to ensure that there are no chest injuries that need to be addressed before possible anesthesia. Treatment will vary based on the location and type of fracture as well as the cat’s age and overall health. Comminuted fractures may be open or closed; an open fracture is one in which the broken bone has punctured the skin or soft tissue, while closed fractures do not pierce the skin or muscles. Treatment methods for open and closed fractures differ. Closed fractures are more straightforward. These should be treated within two to four days with an externally placed splint or cast, but may also be repaired using internal fixation, such as  lockingplate and titanium alloy Kirschner wire. </p><p data-pid="hFbphhHh">Treatment for open fractures is more invasive as there is a risk for bone contamination due to its exposure to the environment. Open fractures are generally treated with two surgical methods. The first is done within eight hours of the initial visit in order to clean the bone. During this time, your cat will be anesthetized and the wound will be flushed and may be treated with antibiotics to eradicate infection. The final surgery to repair the fracture may take place up to 48 hours later.  </p><p data-pid="Vnloqd47">Simple open fractures – e.g. those that do not cause muscle or tissue damage after the initial surgery – may be treated by internal fixation . This will involve surgically restructuring the bone internally using fixative devices such as plates and screws. Complex open fractures that cause muscle damage or cannot be restructured may be treated with external skeletal fixation. During this procedure, your vet will externally apply a metal bar affixed with pins that thread through the fracture. The most severe cases of comminuted fracture may require amputation.</p>
