<strong>如何看待河北一儿童被宠物狗扑倒，其父一气之下将狗摔死，主人痛哭「狗是我的孩子」?有哪些信息值得关注？</strong><br>开穹的回答<br><p data-pid="8VTL5WA8">She thought she was the mother of her dog, but the child who was knocked down was also the father's child.</p><p data-pid="YiqQwAhX">At that time, she didn't well tie leash, didn't make a timely apology after the incident, and even quarreled with the father. This attitude obviously didn't respect other one's child. Can others respect her children?</p><p data-pid="CkBCIT50">People who treat dogs as human or more important, infringe upon legal rights of others due to raising dogs, deserve to be treated as dogs by others.</p>
