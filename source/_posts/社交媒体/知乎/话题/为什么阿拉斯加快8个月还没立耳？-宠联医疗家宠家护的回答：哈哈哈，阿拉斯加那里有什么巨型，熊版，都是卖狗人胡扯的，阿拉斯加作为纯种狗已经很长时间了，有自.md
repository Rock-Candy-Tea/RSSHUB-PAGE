<strong>为什么阿拉斯加快8个月还没立耳？</strong><br>宠联医疗家宠家护的回答<br><p data-pid="p9ZsUVgu">哈哈哈，阿拉斯加那里有什么巨型，熊版，都是卖狗人胡扯的，阿拉斯加作为纯种狗已经很长时间了，有自己的标准，身高在多少厘米左右超过多3厘米，少于多3厘米都是失格，超过6-7厘米范围外就作为混血了。同样，有标准的还有体重，不过这个相对松，也有流行趋势这么各说法，往往几年比赛一个流行，最近10年都是在逐渐减轻体重重量。</p><p data-pid="Qem0POpM">早期阿拉斯加血统不稳定的时候确实有过垂耳的，不过后来逐渐筛选出去了，现在标准都是立耳了。我看您家狗狗的样子包括脸型，尾巴等倒是都和早期70年前有些相似。</p><figure data-size="normal"><img src="https://picx.zhimg.com/v2-88dde7f8d44672caeda7f508bad812d6_1440w.jpg?source=1940ef5c" data-size="normal" data-rawwidth="1693" data-rawheight="859" data-default-watermark-src="https://pica.zhimg.com/50/v2-a9e88c8e9710d64b9114f470df337994_720w.jpg?source=1940ef5c" class="origin_image zh-lightbox-thumb" data-original="https://picx.zhimg.com/v2-88dde7f8d44672caeda7f508bad812d6_r.jpg?source=1940ef5c" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption>美国犬业协会阿拉斯加雪橇犬介绍</figcaption></figure><p data-pid="rZMxGyi7">它可能有一些问题，耳朵，尾巴，脸型，眼睛，鼻子颜色都稍微有一些差异，不过看着很憨厚。下面是阿拉斯加俱乐部的标准，整个标准比较长大概有26页，我节选面部标准，因为视频直看到面部和尾巴，您可以自己去美国网站查询下载</p><h3><b>General Appearance</b></h3><p data-pid="oDO3SPeS">The Alaskan Malamute, one of the oldest Arctic sled dogs, is a powerful and substantially built dog with a deep chest and strong, well-muscled body. The Malamute stands well over the pads, and this stance gives the appearance of much activity and a proud carriage, with head erect and eyes alert showing interest and curiosity. The head is broad. Ears are triangular and erect when alerted. The muzzle is bulky, only slight diminishing in width from root to nose. The muzzle is not pointed or long, yet not stubby. The coat is thick with a coarse guard coat of sufficient length to protect a woolly undercoat. Malamutes are of various colors. Face markings are a distinguishing feature. These consist of a cap over the head, the face either all white or marked with a bar and/or mask. The tail is well furred, carried over the back, and has the appearance of a waving plume. The Malamute must be a heavy boned dog with sound legs, good feet, deep chest and powerful shoulders, and have all of the other physical attributes necessary for the efficient performance of his job. The gait must be steady, balanced, tireless and totally efficient. He is not intended as a racing sled dog designed to compete in speed trials. The Malamute is structured for strength and endurance, and any characteristic of the individual specimen, including temperament, which interferes with the accomplishment of this purpose, is to be considered the most serious of faults.</p><h3><b>Head</b></h3><p data-pid="RhPbDyZx">The head is broad and deep, not coarse or clumsy, but in proportion to the size of the dog. The expression is soft and indicates an affectionate disposition. The eyes are obliquely placed in the skull. Eyes are brown, almond shaped and of medium size. Dark eyes are preferred. Blue Eyes are a Disqualifying Fault. The ears are of medium size, but small in proportion to the head. The ears are triangular in shape and slightly rounded at the tips. They are set wide apart on the outside back edges of the skull on line with the upper corner of the eye, giving ears the appearance, when erect, of standing off from the skull. Erect ears point slightly forward, but when the dog is at work, the ears are sometimes folded against the skull. High set ears are a fault. The skull is broad and moderately rounded between the ears, gradually narrowing and flattening on top as it approaches the eyes, rounding off to cheeks that are moderately flat. There is a slight furrow between the eyes. The topline of the skull and the topline of the muzzle show a slight break downward from a straight line as they join. The muzzle is large and bulky in proportion to the size of the skull, diminishing slightly in width and depth from junction with the skull to the nose. In all coat colors, except reds, the nose, lips, and eye rims’ pigmentation is black. Brown is permitted in red dogs. The lighter streaked “snow nose” is acceptable. The lips are close fitting. The upper and lower jaws are broad with large teeth. The incisors meet with a scissors grip. Overshot or undershot is a fault.</p><p data-pid="sXbxSzyQ">“家宠家护”帮您讲解宠物疾病和健康知识，北京的宠物医生实时在线咨询，每天跟踪记录它身体变化，分析之前的化验结果和身体症状，协助您饲养及恢复健康。安卓手机点击下载下面软件后点“咨询”。 “家宠家护”软件北京医生为您服务，苹果亦可搜索小程序。更多宠物用品供您挑选</p><a href="https://xg.zhihu.com/apk/101f46d08ff8da9a525a59339e1d6cd3356" data-draft-node="block" data-draft-type="link-card" class="internal">家宠家护您的私人宠物健康咨询专家</a><p></p>
