<strong>怎么喂养金蛙？</strong><br>Iptme的回答<br><p data-pid="Nkjcdq8y">Golden tree frogs are insectivores, and in captivity a good portion of their diet can consist of <span class="nolink">live crickets</span>. Crickets should be fed two to three times a week in quantities ranging from two to eight or so per frog depending on the size of the cricket and the size of the frog being fed. Juvenile golden tree frogs should be fed daily as much as they can eat. Several times a month or more other food items, such as wax worms, meal worms, silkworms, moths, flies, or other insects, should be substituted for crickets.</p><p data-pid="nCpWY4Aj">Golden tree frogs are nocturnal and generally prefer to be fed at night, although if a feeder insect catches the attention of a tree frog during the day they won't hesitate to wake up and catch it. Adult frogs should have their food coated with high quality reptile vitamin and mineral supplements once every other feeding. Juveniles should have their food supplemented every time.</p>
