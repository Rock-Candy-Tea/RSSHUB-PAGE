<strong>猫咪得猫藓怎么治最有效？</strong><br>Iptme的回答<br><h2>Ringworm (Dermatophytosis) in Cats</h2><p data-pid="UKXal0Fa">Ringworm (feline dermatophytosis) is a zoonotic disease caused by a fungus, not a worm, and the lesion is not always in the shape of a ring. The scientific name for this disease is Dermatophytosis. It can be passed from an infected cat to a human who comes in contact with it. </p><h3>Cause</h3><p data-pid="KSIcexnW">There are 3 specific fungi of significance in this disease:</p><ul><li data-pid="eQr--mxb">Microsporum canis </li><li data-pid="nAZ7LKj0">Microsporum gypseum – This species of Ringworm is      usually from dogs and cats that dig into contaminated soil.</li><li data-pid="z1ulIGDr">Trichophyton mentagrophytes – This species infects dogs      and cats when they are exposed to rodents or the burrows they live in.</li></ul><h3>Symptoms</h3><p data-pid="d-YSBlHw">The appearance of ringworm varies in cats. Kittens are most likely to be infected. Infected cats can develop bald, scaly, crusted patches with broken hairs. The most common areas for ringworm to occur are the face, ear tips, tail, and feet. Some cats develop small, solid bumps on the skin (called miliary dermatitis) that itch. Cats with widespread ringworm often have larger bumps with open sores.</p><h3>Diagnosis</h3><p data-pid="5yPsCO0U">One of the simplest ways to diagnose Ringworm is with the Woods lamp—an ultraviolet light under which a fungus-coated hair will glow with a yellowish-green color. The hairs that fluoresce in this manner are then examined microscopically for specific spores and other fungal characteristics. Fungal culture of hairs and scrapings from the affected areas is the most accurate method, but it can take up to 3 weeks to get the results. A positive result obtained with an ultraviolet lamp may allow early diagnosis, but the results are not always reliable and need to be verified with a fungal culture.</p><h3>Treatment</h3><p data-pid="zfmIJONV">Topical shampoo therapy is used in almost every case, especially in longer haired pets. It is common to clip some or all of the hair in some pets to make it more effective. These baths will also remove infected hairs that can be the source of an infection to people or other animals.</p><p data-pid="pdh8zpmr">Specific anti fungal cremes are also used when a pet is infected in an area that already has sparse hair growth, or there are small, discrete lesions.</p><p data-pid="yWKxrdE9">Oral anti fungal medications are also used in select cases.  These include ketaconazole and itraconazole.</p>
