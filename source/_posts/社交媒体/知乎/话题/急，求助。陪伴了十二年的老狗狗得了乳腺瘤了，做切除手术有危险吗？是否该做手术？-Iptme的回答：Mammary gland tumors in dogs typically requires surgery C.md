<strong>急，求助。陪伴了十二年的老狗狗得了乳腺瘤了，做切除手术有危险吗？是否该做手术？</strong><br>Iptme的回答<br><p data-pid="CVXt0JBL">Mammary gland tumors in dogs typically requires surgery. Chemotherapy and radiation can be used if the tumor is too large, has been incompletely removed through surgery, or has already metastasized, but surgical removal of the tumor is usually the treatment of choice.   </p><p data-pid="6qMt511z">Tumors that are not cancerous can most likely be left alone (unless cosmetically concerning or bother the dog) but should continue to be monitored for any changes in size or consistency.</p><p data-pid="gpggI0rw">There are five types of surgeries for mammary gland tumors in dogs:  </p><ul><li data-pid="-SPyFHZp"><b>Lumpectomy</b>: removal of the mass  </li><li data-pid="irLWLCub"><b>Simple mastectomy</b>: removal of the mass and associated gland </li><li data-pid="SjOA4oVi"><b>Regional mastectomy</b>: removal of the mass, the associated gland, and nearby glands and lymph nodes </li><li data-pid="4PPfDLoQ"><b>Radical or unilateral mastectomy</b>: removal of the entire mammary chain (radical or unilateral mastectomy)  </li><li data-pid="d_4jPi7e"><b>Bilateral mastectomy</b>: removal of both mammary chains (bilateral mastectomy)</li></ul>
