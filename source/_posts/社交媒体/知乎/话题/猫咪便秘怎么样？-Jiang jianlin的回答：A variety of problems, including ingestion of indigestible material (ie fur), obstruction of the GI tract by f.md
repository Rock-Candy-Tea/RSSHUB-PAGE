In many cases, the specific cause of constipation in cats is undetermined, and in these cases, the condition is referred to as idiopathic constipation.</p><p class="ztext-empty-paragraph"><br></p><p data-pid="1w6jWeGs">Treatment of constipation in cats involves making sure that an affected cat is well hydrated, the elimination of causative agents where possible, medical management using laxatives, enemas, and drugs that increase intestinal motility, dietary modification.</p>
