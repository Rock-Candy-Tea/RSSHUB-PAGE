<strong>深圳建立国内首个宠物方舱，可托管犬猫宠物最大容量 300 只，如何看待疫情下宠物安置问题？</strong><br>自由英语之路的回答<br><h2>《经济学人》：在中国，如果宠物主人感染了新冠，该怎么处理？</h2><p data-pid="yUWDTtnV">原文标题：</p><p data-pid="FUAYA60z"><b>Pets and covid</b></p><p data-pid="gr16ILuV"><b>Leave no dog behind</b></p><p data-pid="T1ZwJq7l">Pet-owners in China are banding together to save furry lives</p><p data-pid="oahPHcMk">When humans test positive for covid, animals pay the price</p><p data-pid="tnlcZb6o">[Paragraph 1] </p><p data-pid="xTHV_29k">“ASK  URBAN Chinese if they see upsides to life in covid-19 lockdown, and a  common reply is: I know my neighbours better. This is especially true of  pet-owners. Tens of millions of Chinese are currently unable to leave  their homes. All face being taken to isolation centres, should they test  positive or be declared close contacts of a virus-carrier. A grim fate  for anyone, centralised quarantine is terrifying for pet-owners, who  must scramble to find a shelter or someone to foster their animals. If  they fail, the creatures may starve in an empty flat or—as has happened  in several cities—be bludgeoned to death by workers sent to disinfect  homes.</p><p class="ztext-empty-paragraph"><br></p><figure data-size="normal"><img src="https://pic1.zhimg.com/v2-8521fbbf1740deb71810707afd812094_1440w.jpg" data-caption data-size="normal" data-rawwidth="852" data-rawheight="466" class="origin_image zh-lightbox-thumb" data-original="https://pic1.zhimg.com/v2-8521fbbf1740deb71810707afd812094_r.jpg" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></figure><p class="ztext-empty-paragraph"><br></p><p class="ztext-empty-paragraph"><br></p><p class="ztext-empty-paragraph"><br></p><p data-pid="iq3xmZOS">[Paragraph 2] </p><p data-pid="UUtoqTZx">One  positive result is an outbreak of neighbourly spirit. Nationwide,  online pet-rescue group chats have formed to swap tips on shelters and  pet-food deliveries, and to draw up lists of neighbours willing to  foster. Some 4,000 pet-owners, Chinese and foreign, have joined group  chats in Shanghai alone. Animal-lovers connected by social media have  saved furry lives by lobbying local officials or security guards bent on  killing.</p><p data-pid="bLyUxKkY">[Paragraph 3] </p><p data-pid="zyLR_UA1">To  date the World Health Organisation has found only farmed mink and pet  hamsters capable of giving covid to humans, with a case involving a  white-tailed deer also under review. Federal health officials in America  call infection risks from pets in general low. No national policy in  China identifies pets as virus vectors. Instead, powers of life and  death have been delegated to grassroots officials told to stop covid at  almost any cost. Several pets have paid the price. In early April a  corgi was filmed being killed with a spade by a guard in Shanghai.  Moments earlier, his despairing, quarantine-bound owner had set him  loose outside his housing compound, not knowing where else to turn.</p><p data-pid="G9QrU-3A">[Paragraph 4] </p><p data-pid="EC-7uqh6">In  Shanghai, pet-owners shared screenshots of a Chinese-language release  form used when some locals were quarantined. Near the end it authorised  pet-killing. With Beijing intent on beating back an Omicron wave, the  capital’s pet-lovers are now mobilising. Unbeknown to Little Black, a  six-year-old mutt being walked this week in eastern Beijing, he has  foster-parents on standby. “I have arranged it with my neighbours  already,” said his owner, a middle-aged woman. “We won’t leave the dog  alone.”</p><p data-pid="0ddD1gXa">（恭喜读完，本篇英语词汇量407左右，有删减）</p><p data-pid="fd8amWaL">原文出自：2022年4月2日《经济学人》China版块<br>精读笔记来源于：自由英语之路</p><p data-pid="dyB0jIdF">本文翻译整理：Irene</p><p data-pid="gUtElDAL">本文编辑校对: Irene<br>仅供个人英语学习交流使用。</p><hr><p class="ztext-empty-paragraph"><br></p><p data-pid="y0Tt86eD"><b>【补充资料】</b>（来自于网络）</p><p data-pid="p2n5-CHv">如果宠物主人感染了新冠病毒，该怎么处理？<br><br>如果宠物主人感染了新冠病毒（无论是疑似还是经检测确诊)，应该避免与宠物或其他动物接触，就像需避免与其他人接触一样，包括爱抚、依偎、亲吻、舔舐、分享食物和睡在同一张床上。<br><br>大多数感染新冠病毒的宠物是在与患者密切接触后而受感染的，宠物可能会发烧、咳嗽、呼吸困难或呼吸急促、嗜睡（异常缺乏活力或行动迟缓）、打喷嚏、流鼻涕、眼睛有分泌物、呕吐或腹泻，若症状严重，可以联系兽医。<br><br>目前各个城市均有新冠隔离人员宠物的托管中心，但在实践过程中仍有许多问题，例如怎样将宠物送至托管中心，需要制定宠物转运流程和隔离管理方案，需要各地政府制定更完善的宠物防疫政策。</p><p class="ztext-empty-paragraph"><br></p><p data-pid="HfR8ANfS"><b>【重点句子】</b>（3个）</p><p data-pid="a3W4wOyu">One positive result is an outbreak of neighbourly spirit. <br><br>Instead, powers of life and death have been delegated to grassroots officials told to stop covid at almost any cost. <br><br>I have arranged it with my neighbours already.
