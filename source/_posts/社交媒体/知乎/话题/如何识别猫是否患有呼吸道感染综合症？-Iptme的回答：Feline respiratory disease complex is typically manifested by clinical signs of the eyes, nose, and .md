<strong>如何识别猫是否患有呼吸道感染综合症？</strong><br>Iptme的回答<br><p data-pid="FudolbIp">Feline respiratory disease complex is typically manifested by clinical signs of the eyes, nose, and mouth (<span class="nolink">rhinosinusitis</span>, sneezing, conjunctivitis, lacrimation, salivation, and oral ulcerations, as well as fever. The principal component infections are feline viral rhinotracheitis (FVR; feline herpesvirus type 1), feline calicivirus (FCV), <i>Chlamydia felis</i>, and <i>Mycoplasma Felis</i>. Feline pneumonitis (<i>Chlamydia psittaci</i>) and mycoplasmal infections appear to be of lesser importance. <span class="nolink">Feline infectious peritonitis</span> typically causes a more generalized condition but may cause signs of mild upper respiratory tract infection. <i>Bordetella bronchiseptica </i>may also contribute to infection. The disease complex is usually self-limiting but can be complicated by secondary bacterial infections. Diagnosis is based on clinical signs and laboratory testing to isolate and identify the agent(s). Treatment is supportive, with antimicrobial treatment for secondary bacterial infection. Prevention is by vaccination.</p>
