<strong>如何判断猫有没有狂犬病？</strong><br>Jiang jianlin的回答<br><p data-pid="FWie3nSt">Most rabid animals show signs of central nervous system disturbance. The most reliable indicators are sudden and severe behavioral changes and unexplained paralysis that worsens over time.  </p><p data-pid="BHKtCmoo">Diagnosis is difficult, especially in areas where rabies is not common. Early stages of rabies can be easily confused with other diseases or with normal aggressive tendencies. A rabies diagnosis must be verified with laboratory tests. </p>
