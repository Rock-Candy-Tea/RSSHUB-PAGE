<strong>有一次我和女朋友去徒步，突然之间有一头巨大的棕熊发疯了似的朝我们冲过来。我们肯定是离小熊仔太近了。好在我身上带了一把9毫米的手枪。只是朝着女朋友的膝盖来了一枪，我就可以从容的走开了。</strong><br>
<em>I was hiking once with my girlfriend. Suddenly a huge brown bear was charging at us, really mad. We must have come close to her cubs. Luckily I had my 9mm pistol with me. One shot to my girlfriend's kneecap was all it took. I could walk away at a comfortable pace.</em>

<strong>曾经有位传教士在非洲一个小部落里传教。整个部落都爱戴他，每一天都会有更多的人改信他的宗教。</strong></p><strong>
<p>但有一天，部落中的一名妇女产下了一个皮肤白皙的孩子。酋长立马就派人去找来传教士，要求他说明为什么会打破自己亲授的戒律。</p>
<p>传教士这一生都是个虔诚的基督徒，就问自己能否看看那个孩子。只是看了一眼孩子，他就明白了，这孩子得了白化病。</p>
<p>于是传教士就试着跟酋长解释，说：“酋长，这个孩子是得了一种皮肤会白化的疾病。跟您举个例子，您养的这群羊，所有的羊都是白色的，但却有一只是黑色的。”</p>
</strong><p><strong>酋长打断了他，说：“这样吧，你要是不跟别人说羊的事儿，我也不再提这孩子的事儿了。”<br>

<em> There was once a missionary preaching in a small African tribe. The people there loved him, and every day more were converted.</em></p><em>
<p>But one day, a white baby was born to one of the women in the tribe. The chief immediately sent for the missionary and demanded to know why he had broken the commandments he had so lovingly taught to his people.</p>
<p>The missionary, having been a devout Christian his entire life, asked to see the child. Upon viewing the baby, it became clear that this baby was an albino.</p>
<p>The missionary attempted to explain this to the chief, saying:</p>
<p>“Chief, this child suffers from a condition of the skin which changed its color to white. As an example, look upon your flocks of sheep. All are white, except for one which is black.”</p>
<p>The chief cuts him off, saying:</p>
</em><p><em>“Ok, I won’t tell about the baby if you don’t tell about the sheep.”</em>
