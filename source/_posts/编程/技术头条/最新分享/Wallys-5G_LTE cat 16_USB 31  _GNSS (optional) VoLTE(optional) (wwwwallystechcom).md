Overview

The RM500Q-GL is a 5G sub-6GHz M.2 module measuring 52.0mm × 30.0mm × 2.3mm which meets the 3GPP Release 15 specification and is optimized for IoT and eMBB applications anywhere in the world outside the US. It supports both standalone (SA) and non-standalone (NSA) modes and delivers maximum downlink rates of 2.5Gbps and maximum uplink rates of 900Mbps. It is compatible with Quectel’s LTE-A category 6 module EM06, category 12 modules EM12 & EM120R-GL, and category 16 module EM160R-GL , enabling customers to migrate from LTE-A to 5G.




The RM500Q-GL supports Qualcomm IZat location technology Gen9C Lite (GPS, GLONASS, BeiDou/Compass, Galileo and QZSS), and the integrated GNSS receiver greatly simplifies product design and makes positioning capabilities quicker and more accurate. A rich set of internet protocols, industry-standard interfaces and abundant functionalities (USB/PCIe drivers for Windows 7/8/8.1/10, Linux, Android) allow the RM500Q-GL to serve a wide range of IoT applications including business routers, home gateways, set top boxes, industrial laptops, consumer laptops, industrial PDAs, rugged tablet PCs, and digital signage.
