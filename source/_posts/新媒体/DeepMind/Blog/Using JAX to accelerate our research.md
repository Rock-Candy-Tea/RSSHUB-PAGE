<p><strong>DeepMind engineers accelerate our research by building tools, scaling up algorithms, and creating challenging virtual and physical worlds for training and testing artificial intelligence (AI) systems. As part of this work, we constantly evaluate new machine learning libraries and frameworks. </strong></p>
<p>Recently, we've found that an increasing number of projects are well served by <a href="https://github.com/google/jax#jax-autograd-and-xla-" rel="noopener" target="_blank">JAX</a>, a machine learning framework developed by <a href="https://research.google/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Google Research</a> teams. JAX resonates well with our engineering philosophy and has been widely adopted by our research community over the last year. Here we share our experience of working with JAX, outline why we find it useful for our AI research, and give an overview of the ecosystem we are building to support researchers everywhere.</p>
