<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s no secret that the gender gap still exists within STEM. Despite a slight increase in recent years, studies show that women only</span> <a href="https://www.stemwomen.co.uk/blog/2019/09/women-in-stem-percentages-of-women-in-stem-statistics">make</a><a href="https://www.stemwomen.co.uk/blog/2019/09/women-in-stem-percentages-of-women-in-stem-statistics"> </a><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.stemwomen.co.uk/blog/2019/09/women-in-stem-percentages-of-women-in-stem-statistics">up about a quarter</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the overall STEM workforce in the UK. While the reasons vary, many women </span><a href="https://www.pwc.co.uk/who-we-are/women-in-technology/time-to-close-the-gender-gap.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> feeling held back by a lack of representation, clear opportunities and information on what working in the sector actually involves. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Closing the gap within STEM is not a quick fix but a collective effort of everyone in the industry. Various organisations like <a href="https://wimlworkshop.org/">Women in Machine Learning</a> (WiML) actively work to help create a more inclusive environment where the successes of women are amplified. They also stand as an important point</span> of i<span style="font-weight: 400;">nformation for the many women who want to learn more about what it’s like to work in STEM. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s why for this year’s <a href="http://www.inwed.org.uk/about.html">International Women in Engineering Day</a>, we asked the WiML community to share with us the most common questions they receive about technical interviewing. To share their perspectives and to discuss what it’s actually like to work at DeepMind, we brought together Mihaela Rosca (Research Engineer), Feryal Behbahani (Research Scientist) and Kate Parkyn (Recruitment Lead - Research & Engineering).</span></p>
