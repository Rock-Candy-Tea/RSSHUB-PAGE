<p>More than a century ago, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Srinivasa_Ramanujan" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Srinivasa Ramanujan</a> shocked the mathematical world with his extraordinary ability to see remarkable patterns in numbers that no one else could see. The self-taught mathematician from India described his insights as deeply intuitive and spiritual, and patterns often came to him in vivid dreams. These observations captured the tremendous beauty and sheer possibility of the abstract world of pure mathematics. In recent years, we have begun to see AI make breakthroughs in <a href="https://deepmind.com/research/case-studies/alphago-the-story-so-far" rel="noopener" target="_blank">areas involving deep human intuition</a>, and more recently on some of the <a href="https://deepmind.com/blog/article/alphafold-a-solution-to-a-50-year-old-grand-challenge-in-biology" rel="noopener" target="_blank">hardest problems across the sciences</a>, yet until now, the latest AI techniques have not assisted in significant results in pure maths research.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As part of <a href="https://deepmind.com/about" rel="noopener" target="_blank">DeepMind's mission</a> to solve intelligence, we explored the potential of machine learning (ML) to recognize mathematical structures and patterns, and help guide mathematicians toward discoveries they may otherwise never have found — demonstrating for the first time that AI can help at the forefront of pure mathematics.</p>
<p></p>
<p><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-04086-x" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Our research paper</a>, published today in the journal Nature, details our collaboration with top mathematicians to apply AI toward discovering new insights in two areas of pure mathematics: topology and representation theory. With <a href="https://www.maths.usyd.edu.au/u/geordie/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Professor Geordie Williamson</a> at the University of Sydney, we discovered a new formula for a conjecture about permutations that has remained unsolved for decades. With <a href="https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/people/marc.lackenby" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Professor Marc Lackenby</a> and <a href="https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/people/andras.juhasz" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Professor András Juhász</a> at the University of Oxford, we have discovered an unexpected connection between different areas of mathematics by studying the structure of knots. These are the first significant mathematical discoveries made with machine learning, according to the top mathematicians who reviewed the work. We’re also releasing full companion papers on arXiv for each result that will be submitted to appropriate mathematical journals (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.15161" rel="noopener" target="_blank">permutations paper</a>; <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.15323" rel="noopener" target="_blank">knots paper</a>). Through these examples, we propose a model for how these tools could be used by other mathematicians to achieve new results.</p>
