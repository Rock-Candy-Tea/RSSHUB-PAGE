<p><strong>We believe artificial intelligence (AI) is one of the most significant technologies of our age and we want to help people understand its potential and how it’s being created. </strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>In 2019, we released <a href="https://deepmind.com/learning-resources/deepmind-the-podcast" rel="noopener" target="_blank">DeepMind: The Podcast</a> to explore these ideas, answer common questions and give an inside look at how AI research happens at a lab like DeepMind. Today, we’re proud to launch a new season, with stories of the latest breakthroughs, innovations, and challenges.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Listeners can find the new episodes on <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/deepmind-the-podcast/id1476316441?l=fr%20" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Apple Podcasts</a>, <a href="https://www.google.com/podcasts?feed=aHR0cHM6Ly9mZWVkcy5zaW1wbGVjYXN0LmNvbS9KVDZwYlBrZw%3D%3D" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Google Podcasts</a>, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/39fjU5Q5L5UecTCRMeqjwb" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Spotify</a>, or their favourite podcast app by searching for “DeepMind: The Podcast”.</p>
