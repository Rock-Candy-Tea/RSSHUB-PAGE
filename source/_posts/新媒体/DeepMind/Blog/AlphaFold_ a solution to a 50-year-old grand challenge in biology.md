<p><strong>Proteins are essential to life, supporting practically all its functions. They are large complex molecules, made up of chains of amino acids, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvTv8TqWC48" rel="noopener" target="_blank">what a protein does largely depends on its unique 3D structure</a>. Figuring out what shapes proteins fold into is known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_folding" rel="noopener" target="_blank">“protein folding problem”</a>, and has stood as a grand challenge in biology for the past 50 years. In a major scientific advance, the latest version of our AI system <a href="https://deepmind.com/research/case-studies/alphafold" rel="noopener" target="_blank">AlphaFold</a> has been recognised as a solution to this grand challenge by the organisers of the biennial Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (<a href="https://predictioncenter.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">CASP</a>). This breakthrough demonstrates the impact AI can have on scientific discovery and its potential to dramatically accelerate progress in some of the most fundamental fields that explain and shape our world.</strong></p>
<p>A protein’s shape is closely linked with its function, and the ability to predict this structure unlocks a greater understanding of what it does and how it works. Many of the world’s greatest challenges, like developing treatments for diseases or finding enzymes that break down industrial waste, are fundamentally tied to proteins and the role they play.</p>
