<p><strong>Restoring, placing, and dating ancient texts through collaboration between AI and historians.</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>The birth of human writing marked the dawn of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History#History_and_prehistory" rel="noopener" target="_blank">History</a> and is crucial to our understanding of past civilisations and the world we live in today. For example, more than 2,500 years ago, the Greeks began writing on stone, pottery, and metal to document everything from leases and laws to calendars and oracles, giving a detailed insight into the Mediterranean region. Unfortunately, it’s an incomplete record. Many of the surviving inscriptions have been damaged over the centuries or moved from their original location. In addition, modern dating techniques, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiocarbon_dating" rel="noopener" target="_blank">radiocarbon dating</a>, cannot be used on these materials, making inscriptions difficult and time-consuming to interpret.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In line with <a href="https://deepmind.com/about" rel="noopener" target="_blank">DeepMind’s mission</a> of solving intelligence to advance science and humanity, we collaborated with the <a href="https://www.unive.it/pag/27720/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Department of Humanities of Ca' Foscari University of Venice</a>, the <a href="https://www.classics.ox.ac.uk/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Classics Faculty of the University of Oxford</a>, and the <a href="https://www.dept.aueb.gr/en/infotech-overview-en" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Department of Informatics of the Athens University of Economics and Business</a> to explore how machine learning can help historians better interpret these inscriptions – giving a richer understanding of ancient history and unlocking the potential for cooperation between AI and historians.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04448-z" rel="noopener" target="_blank">paper</a> published today in <em>Nature</em>, we jointly introduce Ithaca, the first deep neural network that can restore the missing text of damaged inscriptions, identify their original location, and help establish the date they were created. Ithaca is named after the Greek island in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odyssey" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Homer’s <em>Odyssey</em></a> and builds upon and extends <a href="https://deepmind.com/research/publications/2019/Restoring-ancient-text-using-deep-learning-a-case-study-on-Greek-epigraphy" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Pythia</a>, our previous system that focused on textual restoration. Our evaluations show that Ithaca achieves 62% accuracy in restoring damaged texts, 71% accuracy in identifying their original location, and can date texts to within 30 years of their ground-truth date ranges. Historians have already used the tool to reevaluate significant periods in Greek history.</p>

<p>To make our research widely available to researchers, educators, museum staff and others, we partnered with <a href="https://cloud.google.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Google Cloud</a> and <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Google Arts & Culture</a> to launch a <a href="https://ithaca.deepmind.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">free interactive version of Ithaca</a>. And to aid further research, we have also <a href="https://github.com/deepmind/ithaca" rel="noopener" target="_blank">open sourced</a> our code, the pretrained model, and an interactive Colaboratory notebook.</p>
