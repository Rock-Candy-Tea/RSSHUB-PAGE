<p><strong>Today, I’m incredibly proud and excited to announce that DeepMind is making a significant contribution to humanity’s understanding of biology.</strong></p>
<p>When we <a href="https://deepmind.com/blog/article/alphafold-a-solution-to-a-50-year-old-grand-challenge-in-biology">announced AlphaFold 2</a> last December, it was hailed as a solution to the 50-year old protein folding problem. Last week, we published the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03819-2">scientific paper</a> and <a href="https://github.com/deepmind/alphafold/">source code</a> explaining how we created this highly innovative system, and today we’re sharing <a href="https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/">high-quality predictions</a> for the shape of every single protein in the human body, as well as for the proteins of 20 additional organisms that scientists rely on for their research.</p>
<p>As researchers seek cures for diseases and pursue solutions to other big problems facing humankind – including antibiotic resistance, microplastic pollution, and climate change – they will benefit from fresh insights into the structure of proteins. Proteins are like tiny exquisite biological machines. The same way that the structure of a machine tells you what it does, so the structure of a protein helps us understand its function. Today, we are sharing <a href="https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/">a trove of information</a> that doubles <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03828-1">humanity’s understanding of the human proteome</a>, and reveals the protein structures found in 20 other biologically-significant organisms, from E.coli to yeast, and from the fruit fly to the mouse.</p>
