This scent is a shapeshifter. But when it’s not, it’s a dead ringer of another dark, rich, syrupy fig perfume: <b> L’Ile Pourpre </b> by Les Liquides Imaginaires, which is my all time favorite.

<b>Gris Charnel</b> smells like completely different creatures when on hand or on paper. 

On hand it went straight to the “ L’Ile Pourpre ” fig accord, copied to the teeth:

not a cheap fruit, this is a purple tinged plum-like <b>dense sweet tone</b>, complimented by a mysterious <b>savory (“umami”) </b> tone (the mineral sensation brought by MSG or seafood) , and, last but not least, a neurotic touch of a <b>charred / burnt spice </b> —— it’s attributed  to Ginger+Fenugreek in L’Ile Pourpre, or Cardamom absolute in Gris Charnel, call it what you may. 

The extra little thing Gris Charnel used to differentiate itself from L’Ile Pourpre is a <b>neutral powdery tone</b>, either from iris or “sandalwood”. Again, on hand, “sandalwood”(most likely cashmeran) can only manifest itself as a neutral, cold <b>“wall-putty”</b> like tone, hovering outside dense sweet fig accord like a white halo.

Only at the last drydown of skin stage, a bit silky <b>woody fiber </b> tone of synthetic sandalwood is exposed.

On paper that’s completely different story. Real sandalwood took upper hand for a while: a <b>peppery-nutty peanut tone </b> on top, and a ghost-like <b>raw coconut pulp</b> texture wrapped inside fig accord.
