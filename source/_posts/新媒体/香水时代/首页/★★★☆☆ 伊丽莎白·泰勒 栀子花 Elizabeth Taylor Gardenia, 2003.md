The bottle is pretty. I mean it looks like spring. And it has the best kind of green. Just so refreshing. But the juice inside tells you exactly why this is a cheap perfume. Artificial, fake and flat. I guess I am here for the bottle only. Sometimes I get dirty mop lmao. Well I guess I am in just for the bottle like I said already.
