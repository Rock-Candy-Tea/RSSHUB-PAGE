<div>   
Its my mothers perfume. I smelled it when I was a child, and I smelled it again recently. How to say, the top note is not disgusted, can ask out the fruit flavor, in the fat powder flavor is particularly obvious, began to choke panic, especially the taste of the head, the key is that she stays fragrant and very lasting! Base notes of sandalwood and vanilla emerge.
