<p>Biotech startup SweetBio and VC firm VamosVentures receive funding through Apple’s Racial Equity and Justice Initiative</p>
<p><a href="https://www.sweetbio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SweetBio</a> was founded by sister and brother team Kayla Rodriguez Graff and Isaac Rodriguez, whose family is from Puerto Rico.
