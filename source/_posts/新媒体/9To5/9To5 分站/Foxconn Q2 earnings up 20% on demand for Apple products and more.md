<p><a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/foxconn/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Foxconn</a> Q2 earnings were up 20% year-on-year thanks to demand for <a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/aapl/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a> products and other electronics made by the company. Around half of the company’s revenue comes from Apple …</p>

<p><em><a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/iphone-maker-hon-hai-posts-074506407.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Yahoo! Finance</a></em> reports.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>IPhone assembler Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. reported a 20% jump in second-quarter revenue as the pandemic continues to drive demand for electronics from Apple Inc. and other clients.</p>
<p>Revenue in the three months through June rose to NT$1.36 trillion ($48.7 billion), the Taiwanese manufacturer reported, versus estimates for NT$1.34 trillion.</p>
<p>The strong showing from the world’s largest contract electronics maker suggests demand for iPhones, gaming consoles and servers remains robust as consumers snatch up devices for remote work, home-schooling and entertainment needs. Companies are also spending on technology, expanding data-center infrastructure to better serve customers’ online activities.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Demand for Apple products was boosted during the <a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/coronavirus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pandemic</a>, due to people working and studying from home, and needing more home-based entertainment during lockdowns.</p>
<p>COVID-19 has, however, led to chip shortages that Apple has warned will <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/04/28/apple-supply-shortages-ipad-mac/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">affect the supply of both iPads and Macs</a>.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The supply shortages in the fiscal third quarter will primarily impact the Mac and iPad lineups, Cook and CFO Luca Maestri explained during the call. “We expect to be supply-gated, not demand-gated,” Cook told analysts.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Additionally, the pandemic has resulted in loss of production capacity when workers are infected. In particular, vaccine supply has been problematic in Taiwan thanks to <a href="https://telecom.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/worlds-supply-of-chips-is-in-danger-unless-taiwan-gets-vaccines/82899680" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chinese interference</a>. Apple had been trying to help before a deal was struck for key suppliers <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/06/18/covid-19-vaccines-for-taiwan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Foxconn and TSMC to step in</a>.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Apple suppliers TSMC and Foxconn are working on buying millions of doses of COVID-19 vaccines for Taiwan. The plan is for the two companies to buy the vaccines, then donate them to the government for distribution to the people of the island nation.</p>
