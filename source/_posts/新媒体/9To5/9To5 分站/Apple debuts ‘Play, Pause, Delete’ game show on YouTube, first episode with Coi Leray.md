</p>
<p>Here’s how Apple describes the new micro game show:</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>This is Play, Pause, Delete. A game show where we ask your favorite artists to make the tough decisions about music, culture, and everything in between. The rules are simple: We’ll give them three options from a series of personalized categories and watch as they select one to play, one to pause on, and one to delete.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The first episode with <a href="https://apple.co/3stF9rM">rapper Coi Leray</a> aka Big Trend Setter is about 6 minutes long and covers everything from what music she’s listening to, thoughts on birthday gifts, favorite venues, superpowers, and more.</p>
