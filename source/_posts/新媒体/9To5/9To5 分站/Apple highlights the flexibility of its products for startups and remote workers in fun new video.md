<p>Back in 2019, Apple launched a <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/04/02/apple-at-work-video/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fun “Apple at Work” campaign</a> that highlighted how enterprise users can take advantage of iPhone, iPad, and Mac. A year later, the company <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2020/07/13/apple-promotes-working-from-home-in-relatable-new-video-featuring-the-underdogs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released another video</a>, this time featuring employees working from home due to the pandemic. Now “The Underdogs” from the previous videos are back in a new story called “Escape from the Office.”</p>
<p><span id="more-792466"></span>
</p>
<p>Now the group of employees decides to leave the company they work for to found their own startup. As their first project, The Underdogs want to create a “reinforced bag” that has to be stronger and more environmentally friendly than using two regular bags.</p>
<p>In addition to showing some of the things Apple devices are capable of, like sharing Wi-Fi passwords over AirDrop, group FaceTime, hands-free Siri, and advanced AR, the video also promotes the new <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/11/10/apple-business-essentials/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple Business Essentials platform</a> – which combines device management, 24/7 support, and business iCloud storage for businesses of up to 500 employees.</p>
<p>To make things even funnier, the video features references to the popular Apple TV+ show <em>Ted Lasso</em>. At the end of the story, the startup successfully creates the “BetterBag,” which catches the attention of their former boss – or at least they think so.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Apple hardware, software, and services work together to give your employees the power and flexibility to do whatever needs doing — whether you’re running a startup, scale-up, or global enterprise. See how four misfits turn a brilliant idea into a booming small business with the power of Apple.</p>

<p>You can watch the seven-minute video directly on the <a href="https://www.apple.com/business/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple Business website</a> or on YouTube:</p>
