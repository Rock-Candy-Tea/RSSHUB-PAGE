<p>Apple stock has been trading with record highs over the past few weeks, and today the company has reached a new milestone in valuation. The value of a single AAPL share hit around $182.90 during intraday trading, making Apple the first company in the world to be worth $3 trillion.</p>

<p>A growing reliance on ever-expanding services and continuing global success with iPhone, iPad, and the Mac certainly do not hurt. Apple also has a range of new markets to reach with high expectations for the affordably priced 5G iPhone SE, a multi-year roadmap for the company’s pending entry to virtual reality and augmented reality headsets, and a clearer vision for the long-rumored Apple Car project.</p>
<p>Apple is also no stranger to financial milestones among publicly traded companies. In August 2018, the company became the first to reach a $1 trillion valuation. Its value doubled two years later in August 2020 when AAPL reached hit a $2 million market cap. That also means Apple’s valuation added another trillion dollars faster in roughly 16 months than it did between the first and second trillion.</p>

<p>Apple is trailed by Microsoft and Alphabet (Google) in the $2-3 trillion range with Amazon and Tesla occupying the $1-2 trillion range. Following the milestone being reached, $AAPL returned to trading just below the amount that gives the company its $3 trillion valuation — a back and forth that likely won’t last long. </p>
<p>Not bad for a company <a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/steve-jobs/">started in a garage by a college dropout</a> in the mid-70s. A whopping $2.7 trillion in value, of course, has been added under Tim Cook’s leadership after taking over for Steve Jobs in 2011.</p>
