<p>Since the start of the hostage situation in the Apple Store on Leidseplein, several people have been able to leave the building. </p>
<p>We can confirm that the hostage-taker is from the Apple Store. He lies on the street and with a robot he is examined for explosives. From a distance, police officers control him with firearms. The hostage is in safety. </p>
<p>Dozens of people who have previously been able to leave the Apple Store are being collected by police officers. They go to a police location for a witness statement and of course for aftercare such as Victim Support.</p>
