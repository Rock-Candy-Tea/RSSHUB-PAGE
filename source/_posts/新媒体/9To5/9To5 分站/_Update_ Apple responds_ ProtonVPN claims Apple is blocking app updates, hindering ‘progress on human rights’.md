<p>Proton Technologies founder Andy Yen has written an <a href="https://protonvpn.com/blog/apple-blocks-app-updates/">open letter</a> today that claims Apple is standing “in the way of human rights.” The core issue is Apple not approving a ProtonVPN iOS app update that comes amid the <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/graphics/2021/03/20/myanmar-military-coup-protests-violence-deaths-burma-videos/6868486002/">turmoil in Myanmar</a>.</p>

<p><strong><em>Update 3/24 6:00 pm PT: </em></strong>We’ve got a statement from Apple on the matter, and it sounds like Proton has made more of this than what it actually was including choosing to delay the approved update by two days.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>All apps made by Proton, including ProtonVPN, have remained available for download in Myanmar. We approved the most recent version of ProtonVPN on March 19. Following this approval, Proton chose to time the release of their update, making it available on March 21st, while subsequently publishing their blog post on March 23rd.</p>
