<p>A survey by a software engineer recruitment company has found that three-quarters of developers want permanent remote-working arrangements, for at least part of the week.</p>
<p>Two-thirds of them say they are more productive when working from home, and it appears that <a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/aapl/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple’s</a> policy somewhat misses the mark for most …</p>

<h2 id="h-background">Background </h2>
<p>Most Apple corporate employees are working from home at present, with the company having <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/12/15/apple-delay-office-employee-return/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">given up on predicting</a> when they will return to the office.</p>
<p>Back in June of last year, CEO <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/06/02/apple-hybrid-work-plan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tim Cook announced a hybrid work plan</a>, in which employees would work from the office three days a week, with remote working available to most the other two.</p>
<p><a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/06/04/apple-remote-work-letter-employees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Following kickback from employees</a> who <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/06/05/re-apple-remote-work/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wanted greater flexibility</a> – including the option to work remotely five days a week – Cook was initially adamant that there would be <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/06/29/apple-says-in-person-work-is-essential-and-will-not-go-back-from-its-hybrid-work-plan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">no change to the policy</a>. The company did later make one concession: allowing staff to <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/11/18/apple-delays-return-to-in-person-work-to-february-will-allow-up-to-four-weeks-of-remote-work-per-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">work fully remotely for four weeks a year</a>, up from the two weeks originally offered.</p>
<h2 id="h-most-software-engineers-want-permanent-remote-working">Most software engineers want permanent remote working</h2>
<p>A survey of a thousand software engineers by recruitment company <a href="https://terminal.io/state-of-remote-engineering" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Terminal</a> found that 75% of them wanted to work remotely on a permanent basis – at least for part of the week.</p>
<p>However, it appears that the gap between Apple’s offer and what most developers want may not be insurmountable: the greatest support was for a hybrid model of three days a week of remote work, one more than Apple’s two.</p>
<p>The reason for wanting to work from home includes both work and personal reasons. Some 68% of developers say they are more productive working from home, given a quiet environment and fewer interruptions. A similar number says that it gives them a better work-life balance, and almost half say they feel less stressed when working remotely.</p>
<p>A hybrid model does seem optimal, however, <em><a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/software-developers-say-theyre-happier-working-from-home-but-its-still-far-from-perfect/?ftag=COS-05-10aaa0g&taid=61e157e2df9b5d00016fccc9&utm_campaign=trueAnthem%3A+Trending+Content&utm_medium=trueAnthem&utm_source=twitter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ZDNet</a></em> noted some of the reasons cited for wanting to be in the office two days a week.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Isolation was found to be a key complaint of software engineers working remotely. Just over half (55%) of survey respondents said they suffer from a lack of day-to-day social personal interactions, while 40% cited loneliness or feelings of isolation.</p>
<p>The lack of direct contact with others also makes collaboration and inclusion more difficult, said 38% of developers. Meanwhile, 31% said working remotely makes it more difficult to pursue career development because they are less visible to their managers and supervisors.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Previous surveys have found that many would be <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/08/25/continued-work-from-home-pay-cut/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">willing to take a pay cut</a> to work from home permanently, with some higher earners willing to <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/04/06/working-from-home-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sacrifice up to $30K a year</a>.</p>
