<p>This year we‚Äôve seen Apple employees speak out about their negative experiences at the company and advocate for change publicly in a way we haven‚Äôt witnessed before. And after forming the <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/08/27/appletoo-stories-500-so-far/">#AppleToo movement</a> that picked up momentum earlier this year, the group has evolved with the latest effort being a walkout on Christmas Eve.</p>

</p>
<p>Spotted by <a href="https://twitter.com/ZoeSchiffer/status/1474120789892878336">Zo√´ Schiffer</a>, previously organized under AppleToo, ‚ÄúApple Together‚Äù shared a call to action for both Apple employees and Apple customers on <a href="https://twitter.com/AppleLaborers/status/1474119772384096271">Twitter</a> this afternoon.</p>
<p>While a good portion of Apple‚Äôs corporate employees will be on holiday vacation on Christmas Eve/Christmas weekend, many of Apple‚Äôs retail and AppleCare employees are scheduled to work.</p>
<p>As shown in the image above, Apple Together is asking for better working conditions including a respectful workplace, paid sick time, protection on the frontlines, and proper mental healthcare.</p>
<p>While the goal is to have any and all Apple employees walkout/callout, Apple Together is also asking customers to not shop at Apple on Christmas Eve.</p>
<p>The group also has a <a href="https://appletogether.org/">website with more specifics</a> on its mission.</p>
