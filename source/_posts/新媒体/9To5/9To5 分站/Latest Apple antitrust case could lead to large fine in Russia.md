<p>The latest Apple <a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/antitrust/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">antitrust</a> case could see the company face an unspecified fine in Russia. It follows the company failing to meet a September deadline for allowing app developers to tell customers about alternative payment options.</p>
<p>While the potential size of the fine is not specified, the wording implies that it could be significant … </p>

<h2 id="h-background">Background</h2>
<p><a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/aapl/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a> has faced a large number of antitrust investigations and lawsuits around the world over its monopoly position in the sale of <a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/app-store/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">iOS apps</a> and in-app payments. You can read more this disputed monopoly status in <a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/antitrust/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our antitrust guide</a>.</p>
<p>One specific bone of contention has been the anti-steering rules Apple applied. These stated that developers were not allowed to tell app users about alternative means of payment for in-app purchases, which enabled Apple to take its cut of all this revenue.</p>
<p>The Cupertino company did <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/08/26/apple-small-business-app-store-changes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">agree to change these rules</a> back in August, but has done so in <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/08/27/apples-app-store-changes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an extremely limited way</a> which fails to satisfy all regulators and developers.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Before, developers couldn’t even <em>email</em> app users to let them know about alternative payment options. Now they can – but that’s it.</p>
<p>Developers <em>still</em> can’t provide a link within the app to an alternative payment platform. Indeed, the company confirmed to us that developers aren’t even allowed to <em>mention</em> alternative payment methods inside the app.</p>
<p>Yes, an app can ask for a user’s email address – but cannot do so with a message saying do this so we can tell you about subscription options. If a user provides their email, then the developer can email them a link to payment options, but developers still can’t steer users to these within the app.</p>
<p>So Apple has settled this specific lawsuit, but still has an anti-steering policy, and so yesterday’s announcement will do nothing to allay antitrust concerns.</p>

<p>Russia is among the countries not impressed with Apple’s limited response, reports <em><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/apple-russia/russia-opens-case-against-apple-in-app-store-payment-dispute-idUSKBN2HH0OB" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Reuters</a>.</em></p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Russia has opened an antitrust case against Apple for failing to allow app developers to tell customers about alternative payment options when using its App Store platform, Russia’s anti-monopoly regulator said on Wednesday […]</p>
<p>The company was earlier issued with a warning over the issue and given a Sept. 30 deadline to “stop abuse on the market”, the Roskomnadzor regulator said in a statement.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The regulator said that if Apple is found guilty of anti-competitive action, then it will face a fine ‘based on its revenue in Russia.’</p>
