<p>After a trial that lasted more than a year, Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers finally issued her <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/09/10/epic-vs-apple-ruling-revealed-apple-must-allow-app-store-devs-to-redirect-users-to-other-payment-systems/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">permanent injunction in the case of Apple vs Epic Games</a>.</p>
<p>While Apple will be forced to change some of the App Store guidelines, Epic Games has been ordered to pay Apple a 30% commission of all sales the company registered by bypassing the App Store’s in-app purchases system with Fortnite last year. Now Epic has done just that and paid Apple $6 million.</p>

</p>
<p>The payment was confirmed by Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney himself on <a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1437526574518214657?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1437526574518214657%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2F9to5mac.com%2Fwp-admin%2Fpost.php%3Fpost%3D752511action%3Dedit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitter</a>, who also shared a joke about paying the fine using Apple Pay.</p>
<p>In 2020, Epic Games released an update to Fortnite for iOS that introduced its own payment system for in-game content. The company promoted the new system as a cheaper way to purchase game items, since its own system did not require paying the App Store commission.</p>
<p>Judge Rogers ordered Epic to pay Apple 30% of $12,167,719 in revenue, which is the amount the company earned by bypassing the App Store’s in-app purchases system at the time.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Apple has also been ordered to let developers offer in-app content through third-party payment services, but the company <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/09/10/apple-not-required-to-let-fortnite-back-on-the-app-store-despite-epic-ruling/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will not have to let Fortnite and Epic return to the App Store</a>.</p>
