<p>Apple’s <a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/app-store/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">App Store commission</a> is under threat from a new <a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/antitrust/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">antitrust</a> law in Korea that is “almost certain” to get the necessary votes today.</p>
<p>It would allow developers to choose their own payment platforms, and avoid the 15% or 30% cut they currently have to pay to Apple for app sales and in-app purchases. </p>

<h2 id="h-background">Background</h2>
<p>Apple’s monopoly on the sale of iOS apps and in-app purchases is <a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/antitrust/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the biggest antitrust concern</a> about the tech giant. While Apple claims that the relevant market definition is “smartphone apps,” in which it does not have a monopoly, many regulators and legislators around the world view the market definition as “iOS apps,” in which it does.</p>
<p>This is because it is not realistic for most developers to launch an Android app but not an iOS one. An iOS app is essential to reach a large slice of the population.</p>
<p>Many developers would like the option to bypass Apple as a payment platform, and an increasing number of governments seem sympathetic to this.</p>
<p>Apple’s view remains that it created the market for iOS apps, and is entitled to be rewarded for this, and for the opportunity it offers to developers. The company did <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2020/11/18/comment-apples-small-business-program-is-a-huge-and-extremely-clever-u-turn/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">make a massive U-turn</a> when it <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2020/11/18/app-store-small-business-program/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cut its commission from 30% to 15%</a> for <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2020/11/30/report-98-of-devs-15-percent-commission/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the vast majority of developers</a>, but has so far stuck to its guns when it comes to its anti-steering policy, offering <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/08/27/apples-app-store-changes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">only a tiny concession</a> to <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/08/26/apple-small-business-app-store-changes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">settle a recent lawsuit</a>.</p>
<h2 id="h-app-store-commission-under-threat-in-south-korea">App Store commission under threat in South Korea</h2>
<p>We last week reported that <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/08/24/apple-concerned-south-korea-app-store-bill/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">South Korea was working on a law</a> to force both Apple and Google to allow developers to offer third-party payment platforms within their apps. A vote might have happened the very next day, but was delayed, likely to ensure it had sufficient support to pass.</p>
<p><em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-29/apple-google-mobile-dominance-faces-tough-test-in-korea" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bloomberg</a></em> reports that the vote takes place today, and support now looks solid.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>South Korea is expected to become the first country to pass a law ending Apple and Google’s domination of payments on their mobile platforms, setting a potentially radical precedent for their lucrative app store operations everywhere from India to the US […]</p>
<p>The Telecommunications Business Act would mandate giving users a free choice of app payment providers. The bill, which is almost certain to pass an assembly vote Monday given the ruling party’s super-majority, opens the door for companies like Fortnite maker Epic Games Inc. to transact directly with users and bypass the platform owner’s charges.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Other governments will be watching closely, and one analyst says that the prevailing mood around the world suggests that other countries may well follow Korea’s lead.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>“This could presage similar actions elsewhere,” said Omdia analyst Guillermo Escofet, who specializes in digital consumer platforms. “Regulators, lawmakers and litigators in North America and Europe are also scrutinizing app-store billing rules, and the overriding political mood has become hostile to the enormous amount of power concentrated in the hands of the tech giants.”</p>
