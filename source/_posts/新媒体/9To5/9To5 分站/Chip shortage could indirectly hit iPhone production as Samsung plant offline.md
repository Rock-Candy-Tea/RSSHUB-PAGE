<p>It was reported yesterday that the global chip shortage was “<a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/03/17/chip-shortage-affecting-everybody-except-apple/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">affecting everyone except Apple</a>,” with two factors insulating the iPhone maker. That isn’t quite accurate, as <a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/iphone-12/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">iPhone 12</a> production has been constrained by shortages of both <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2020/11/05/iphone-12-pro-orders-slip-into-december-due-to-component-shortages/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">power management chips and LiDAR components</a>, but it’s certainly true that the Cupertino company is in a much better position than most.</p>
<p>However, it seems Apple may have another worry, as a <a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/samsung/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Samsung</a> plant responsible for 5% of global chip supply has been out of action for over a month … </p>
<p><span id="more-704778"></span>
</p>
<h2 id="h-background">Background</h2>
<p>Apple has so far been relatively safe from the chip shortage thanks to two factors. First, it designs and commissions its own A-series chips from TSMC, while Android brands are all competing for the same processors from a small number of chipmakers: mostly Qualcomm, Samsung, HiSilicon and MediaTek. </p>
<p>Second, Apple has long been the unrivaled champion of Operations, which includes securing priority component orders well in advance, and sometimes negotiating <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2017/07/03/apple-lg-oled-investment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple-only production lines</a>.</p>
<p>Yesterday, an analyst commented on the iPhone maker being the only one as yet unaffected.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>MS Hwang, an analyst at Samsung Securities, told Bloomberg that “the tightened supply of Qualcomm AP chips produced by TSMC is affecting everybody except Apple.”</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="h-samsung-chip-shortage-could-hit-apple">Samsung chip shortage could hit Apple</h2>
<p>But a <em><a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Tech/Semiconductors/Samsung-chip-fallout-threatens-smartphone-and-PC-supplies" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nikkei</a></em> report today suggests that iPhone production may still be indirectly hit by the ongoing shutdown at a key Samsung plant.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The shortage spurred by strong chip demand during the pandemic has been exacerbated by the shutdown of a Samsung plant in Texas following a winter storm. The chip fabrication plant responsible for 5% of global supply has been idled since Feb. 16, causing widespread repercussions through the supply chain.</p>
<p>“There’s a serious imbalance in supply and demand of chips in the IT sector globally,” Koh Dong-Jin, the co-CEO who oversees Samsung’s mobile division, said Wednesday at a shareholders’ meeting.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The reason? Samsung makes a lot of iPhone <a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/oled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">OLED</a> screens, and the driver chips for these were made in the Texas plant.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The facility also produces chips for organic light-emitting diode panels and for image sensors. The supply crunch hitting Qualcomm will affect a wide range of smartphone makers that rely on the company for key components. Apple, which procures OLED panels from Samsung, could also face disruptions in iPhone production.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However tight things get for Apple, Samsung itself is seemingly left in a far worse position. It was reported yesterday that the Korean company <a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/03/16/samsung-galaxy-note-2021-chip-shortage/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">may fail to launch a 2021 Galaxy Note</a> thanks to the chip shortage.</p>
