<p>Following multiple discussions about Apple employees returning to the company’s offices, <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-20/apple-will-postpone-return-to-office-after-covid-19-persists?sref=4ZGeBqkb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bloomberg</a></em> has now reported that Apple has decided to delay the return to in-person work for at least a month. According to people familiar with the matter, the decision is related to the COVID-19 variants that have been spreading across several countries.</p>
<p><span id="more-738476"></span>
</p>
<p>As the COVID-19 vaccination accelerates around the world, Apple CEO Tim Cook announced in June that Apple employees would return to the office in September. In a memo sent to employees, Cook mentioned that employees would have to work in person three days a week until at least 2022.</p>
<p>However, even with vaccination, COVID-19 variants are still driving up virus cases in multiple countries where the number of deaths is still alarmingly high. This has resulted in companies having to rethink their in-person work strategies for 2021.</p>
<p>While companies like Facebook and Google have been more flexible when it comes to working from home, Apple has opted for a hybrid model in which employees would have to work from the office three days a week. Some Apple employees have already been working in the offices on certain days, but this would become mandatory starting in September.</p>
<p>Now according to <em>Bloomberg</em>, Apple does not expect to return to the office until October.</p>
<p>In the meantime, a group of employees have been expressing discontent with Apple’s strict policy of not allowing people to work from home permanently. Apple says that “in-person collaboration is essential” to the culture of the company, and despite this delay, it doesn’t mean for now that the company will change its decision based on these complaints.</p>
