<p><a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/aapl/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a> has finally announced that it will comply with a law in South Korea, requiring it to allow third-party <a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/app-store/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">App Store</a> payments, some four months after the <a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/antitrust/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">antitrust</a> law was passed. The law also applies to Google, which is already in compliance.</p>
<p>As expected, the Cupertino company says that it will still take a cut of all App Store sales, though this will be at a reduced rate … </p>

<h2 id="h-background">Background</h2>
<p>Apple’s monopoly on the sale of iOS apps has been <a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/antitrust/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the biggest antitrust concern</a> surrounding the company. Apple tried to <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2020/11/18/comment-apples-small-business-program-is-a-huge-and-extremely-clever-u-turn/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stave off regulatory pressure</a> by reducing its commission <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2020/11/18/app-store-small-business-program/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">from 30% to 15%</a> for the <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2020/11/30/report-98-of-devs-15-percent-commission/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">vast majority of developers</a>, but <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/09/10/epic-vs-apple-ruling-revealed-apple-must-allow-app-store-devs-to-redirect-users-to-other-payment-systems/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">still lost a major US case</a> banning developers from directing users to third-party payment platforms.</p>
<p><a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/08/24/apple-concerned-south-korea-app-store-bill/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In South Korea, a law was passed</a> that had the same effect of forcing both Google and Apple to allow app developers to use third-party payment platforms. </p>
<p>The law came into effect back in September of last year, but <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/08/31/app-store-payment-platform-monopoly-ending/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple initially fought against compliance</a>.</p>
<h2 id="h-apple-will-allow-third-party-app-store-payments">Apple will allow third-party App Store payments</h2>
<p><em><a href="http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20220111000624" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Korea Herald</a></em> reports that Apple has now said that it will comply with the law.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Apple will allow alternative payment systems in South Korea in compliance with a new local law that bans app store operators from forcing their own in-app payment systems, the country’s telecommunications regulator said Tuesday […]</p>
<p>Apple said it plans to provide an alternative payment system at a reduced service charge compared with the current 30 percent charge, as the tech giant turned in its compliance plans to the Korea Communications Commission (KCC).</p>
<p>The company did not provide the exact date of when the policy will take effect or the service fee to be applied but said it plans to discuss with the KCC on further details […]</p>
<p>“Apple has a great deal of respect for Korea’s laws and a strong history of collaboration with the country’s talented app developers. Our work will always be guided by keeping the App Store a safe and trusted place for our users to download the apps they love,” it added.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Other countries are expected to follow the examples of the US and South Korea, and many antitrust experts believe that Apple will eventually be forced to adopt this policy globally.</p>
