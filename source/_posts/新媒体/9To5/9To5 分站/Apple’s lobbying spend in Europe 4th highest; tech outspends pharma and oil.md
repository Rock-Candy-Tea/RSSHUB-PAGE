<p>A new report reveals <a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/aapl/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple’s</a> lobbying spend in Europe, and notes that tech giants spend more on trying to influence European legislation than any other sector. This includes both pharma and oil industries.</p>



<p>The biggest European legislative threat to Apple is the Digital Markets Act, which could force Apple to open up its App Store to third-party payment platforms, allowing developers to avoid the Cupertino company’s 15% or 30% cut … </p>

<h2 id="h-background">Background</h2>



<p>Apple has historically spent relatively little on lobbying compared to other tech giants. Until 2016, for example, Apple’s US lobbying spend had never exceeded $5M a year – compared to companies like Google and Facebook <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2020/01/22/apple-lobbying-spending-2019/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spending in the $11.8M to $16.7M range</a>.</p>



<p>However, the company’s lobbying spend has been increasing in recent years, hitting $7.4M in the US in 2019.</p>



<p>This in large part reflects the change in the landscape of both public opinion and legislative priorities. The ad-driven business models of Google and Facebook meant they were threatened by <a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">privacy</a> legislation like <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2018/05/25/gdpr-apple/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Europe’s GDPR</a>. Apple had <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/01/18/apple-gdpr/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">little to fear</a> from this – but a global focus on new <a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/antitrust/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">antitrust</a> laws does put its Services revenue at risk, especially in regard to the <a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/app-store/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">App Store</a>.</p>



<p>Only today, <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/08/31/app-store-payment-platform-monopoly-ending/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">South Korea passed legislation</a> that would require both Apple and Google to permit the use of third-party payment platforms in their app stores, enabling developers to bypass the 15% or 30% cuts taken by the companies. Other countries are likely to follow suit.</p>



<h2 id="h-apple-s-lobbying-spend-in-europe">Apple’s lobbying spend in Europe</h2>



<p>A <a href="https://corporateeurope.org/sites/default/files/2021-08/The%20lobby%20network%20-%20Big%20Tech%27s%20web%20of%20influence%20in%20the%20EU.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">report</a> by lobbying transparency groups Corporate Europe Observatory and LobbyControl found that the tech sector now spends more on lobbying than any other industry. Apple spent €3.5M ($4.1M) last year, putting it in fourth place behind Google, Facebook, and Microsoft.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>As Big Tech’s market power has grown, so has its political clout. Just as the EU tries to rein in the most problematic aspects of Big Tech – from disinformation, targeted advertising to excessive market power – the digital giants are lobbying hard to shape new regulations […]</p><p>[Tech companies collectively] spend over € 97 million annually lobbying the EU institutions. This makes tech the biggest lobby sector in the EU by spending, ahead of pharma, fossil fuels, finance, or chemicals.</p><p>In spite of the varied number of players, this universe is dominated by a handful of firms. Just ten companies are responsible for almost a third of the total tech lobby spend (in increasing order by spend): Vodafone (€ 1,750,000), IBM (€ 1.750.000), QUALCOMM (€ 1.750.000), Intel (€ 1,750,000), Amazon (€ 2,750,000), Huawei (€ 3,000,000), Apple (€ 3,500,000), Microsoft (€ 5,250,000), Facebook (€ 5,550,000) and with the highest budget, Google (€ 5,750,000).</p></blockquote>

<p>The report argues that this gives tech giants too much ability to influence legislation in their favor.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>These huge lobbying budgets have a significant impact on EU policy-makers, who find digital lobbyists knocking on their door on a regular basis. More than 140 lobbyists work for the largest ten digital firms day to day in Brussels and spend more than € 32 million on making their voice heard.</p><p>Big Tech companies don’t just lobby on their own behalf; they also employ an extensive network of lobby groups, consultancies, and law firms representing their interests, not to mention a large number of think tanks and other groups financed by them. The business associations lobbying on behalf of Big Tech alone have a lobbying budget that far surpasses that of the bottom 75 per cent of the companies in the digital industry.</p></blockquote>
