<p>It’s easier than ever to stream Apple’s events nowadays. Like all events over the past 18 months, Apple’s October event is completely virtual due to the COVID-19 pandemic. You can stream the event through <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-events/">Apple’s website</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/Apple">Apple’s YouTube channel</a>, and through the Apple TV application on iPhone, iPad, and Mac. </p>
<p>Here are the full details on the process, including an embedded player for watching right here on 9to5Mac: </p>

<h2 id="h-what-to-expect">What to expect</h2>
<p>Again, we expect new MackBook Pro models powered by Apple’s M1X processor to the stars of today’s show. The new MacBook Pros are rumored to feature more powerful chips inside, mini-LED display technology, the return of an SD card slot and HDMI port, MagSafe for charging, and much more. </p>
<p>Rumors also suggest that Apple could unveil a Mac mini powered by the same M1X processor, as well as AirPods 3. The new AirPods are expected to feature a new design, a redesigned charging case, and more. </p>
