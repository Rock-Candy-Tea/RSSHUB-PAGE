<p><a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/01/27/aapl-earnings-q1-2021-apple/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AAPL revenue grew a remarkable 21%</a> in the holiday quarter, the company setting new records for both revenue and profit. One notable <a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/aapl/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a> analyst suggests that the good news is set to continue, and is forecasting 15% year-on-year growth when the company reports its fiscal Q2 earnings later this month.</p>
<p>Horace Dediu says the story is a remarkable contrast to some of the doom-and-gloom predictions made when the <a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/coronavirus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pandemic</a> first hit … </p>

<p><a href="http://www.asymco.com/2021/04/08/forecasting-the-past/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dediu notes</a> that AAPL’s share price fell significantly early in the pandemic, with some fearing that nobody would be willing or able to buy premium tech.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The months leading to pandemic caused the share prices of most equities to fall, and tech was not immune. Apple’s shares fell in March 2020 to $57/share. I heard comments suggesting that Apple would collapse as a business with unemployment reaching 25% and nobody willing to pay for luxuries like iPhones.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We know now, of course, that such concern was entirely misplaced, and that working from home, and the closure of many entertainment venues, saw people willing to spend more – rather than less – on their tech.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The “work and study from home” and lockdowns have forced people to buy more technology. Phones, Laptops, tablets are not just tools but lifelines for a society denied other forms of contact […]</p>
<p>The crisis has proven that technology is not a luxury but a necessity, and technology that works better is far more valuable than technology that works barely. Spending on better machines has increased.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Additionally, what else did we have to spend our money on?</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The economic fuel for Apple’s growth came from disposable income being unspent on other high-ticket items like dining, vacations and entertainment. Much cash sloshing around the economy surely ended up in an Apple cash register.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dediu says that we are seeing a trickle of data suggesting that demand is unabated, so he forecasts 15% year-on-year growth in AAPL revenue for fiscal Q2 (calendar Q1).</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Given this, I am tentatively projecting top line growth of 15% (vs. 1% a year ago and 21% last quarter) and EPS growth of 11% (vs. 3.8% year ago and 25.6% last quarter.)</p>
