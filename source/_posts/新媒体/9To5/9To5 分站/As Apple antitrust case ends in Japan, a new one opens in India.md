<p>A new Apple <a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/antitrust/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">antitrust</a> case has been opened in <a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/india/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">India</a>, the day after another one ended in <a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/japan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Japan</a>. Both cases relate to Apple’s cut of <a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/app-store/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">App Store</a> sales.</p>

<h2 id="h-background">Background</h2>



<p>The antitrust pressure on Apple’s App Store business model grows stronger by the day. We recently <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/08/30/apples-app-store-commission-korea/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">summarized the background</a> to this.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Apple’s monopoly on the sale of iOS apps and in-app purchases is <a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/antitrust/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the biggest antitrust concern</a> about the tech giant. While Apple claims that the relevant market definition is “smartphone apps,” in which it does not have a monopoly, many regulators and legislators around the world view the market definition as “iOS apps,” in which it does.</p><p>This is because it is not realistic for most developers to launch an Android app but not an iOS one. An iOS app is essential to reach a large slice of the population.</p><p>Many developers would like the option to bypass Apple as a payment platform, and an increasing number of governments seem sympathetic to this.</p><p>Apple’s view remains that it created the market for iOS apps, and is entitled to be rewarded for this, and for the opportunity it offers to developers. The company did <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2020/11/18/comment-apples-small-business-program-is-a-huge-and-extremely-clever-u-turn/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">make a massive U-turn</a> when it <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2020/11/18/app-store-small-business-program/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cut its commission from 30% to 15%</a> for <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2020/11/30/report-98-of-devs-15-percent-commission/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the vast majority of developers</a>, but has so far stuck to its guns when it comes to its anti-steering policy, offering <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/08/27/apples-app-store-changes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">only a tiny concession</a> to <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/08/26/apple-small-business-app-store-changes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">settle a recent lawsuit</a>.</p></blockquote>



<p>Last week, Apple settled a developer lawsuit by allowing them to <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/08/26/apple-small-business-app-store-changes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">email app users with alternative payment options</a>. On Tuesday, South Korea passed a law that would force Apple and Google to <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/08/31/app-store-payment-platform-monopoly-ending/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">allow developers to use third-party payment platforms</a>, and just yesterday <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/09/01/apple-will-let-developers-redirect-users-to-sign-up-for-services-outside-the-app-store/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple had to agree to a major change in policy</a> to end an App Store investigation in Japan.</p>



<h2 id="h-apple-antitrust-case-opens-in-india">Apple antitrust case opens in India</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/exclusive-apple-hit-with-antitrust-case-india-over-in-app-payments-issues-2021-09-02/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Reuters</a> reports that Indian regulators are now investigating the legality of App Store commissions.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Apple is facing an antitrust challenge in India for allegedly abusing its dominant position in the apps market by forcing developers to use its proprietary in-app purchase system, according to a source and documents seen by Reuters […]</p><p>The Indian case was filed by a little-known, non-profit group which argues Apple’s fee of up to 30% hurts competition by raising costs for app developers and customers, while also acting as a barrier to market entry.</p><p>“The existence of the 30% commission means that some app developers will never make it to the market … This could also result in consumer harm,” said the filing, which has been seen by Reuters.</p></blockquote>



<p>Additionally, the complaint argues that Apple’s policy harms Indian payment processing companies, because developers would use those if the iPhone maker didn’t ban them from doing so.</p>



<p>Some are speculating that India is likely to take the complaint more seriously because the European Union is already <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/03/08/european-antitrust-complaint-critical/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">carrying out its own investigation</a> into the same issue, alongside <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2020/12/15/apple-eu-legislation-app-store-changes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">planned new legislation</a> on the issue.</p>



<p><a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/08/27/apples-app-store-changes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple continues</a> to make <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2020/06/24/apples-antitrust-issues-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">small, piecemeal changes</a> in the hope of <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/08/26/apple-small-business-app-store-changes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dealing with lawsuits</a> and investigations <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/09/01/apple-will-let-developers-redirect-users-to-sign-up-for-services-outside-the-app-store/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one at a time</a>. While some would consider this prudent, only giving away as much as it has to each time, others argue that Apple could turn a never-ending series of concessions <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/06/23/app-store-mess/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">into a PR win</a> by announcing wholesale changes, which could strike out all the antitrust cases against it in one go.</p>
