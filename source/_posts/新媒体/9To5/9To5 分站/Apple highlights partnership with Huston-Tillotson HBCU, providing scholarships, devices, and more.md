<p>Apple has shared more about its recent partnership to help support Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), this time with Huston-Tillotson University. With a multi-year program, Apple is offering scholarships, hardware, software, as well as professional development to help support the next generation of Black male educators.</p>

</p>
<p>The partnership with Huston-Tillotson University is the latest of Apple’s <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/01/13/apple-announces-major-new-reji-projects-to-tackle-systemic-racism/">Racial Equity and Justice Initiative</a> (REJI), something it’s pledged $100 million for. Apple highlighted partnership in a <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/05/a-new-generation-of-black-male-teachers-starts-its-journey-in-partnership-with-apple/">Newsroom post today</a>:</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Apple’s multiyear partnership with Huston-Tillotson complements other engagements the company has established through its Racial Equity and Justice Initiative, working alongside the HBCU community to develop curricula and provide new learning and workforce opportunities.</p>
<p>At Huston-Tillotson, Apple is providing scholarships for the program’s students, called Pre-Ed Scholars, as well as hardware, software, and professional-development courses for students and faculty.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One of the goals of the program that started last year is to help increase the amount of Black male teachers – something the US needs badly.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Currently, only 2 percent of all US teachers are Black men, something the program at Huston-Tillotson seeks to change. When Black students are taught by a Black teacher, they are significantly more likely to graduate high school and consider attending college.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Apple highlighted Rhys Richard who is finishing his “freshman year remotely as part of the inaugural class of the African American Male Teacher Initiative at Huston-Tillotson University.” Here’s what he had to say about the importance of the program when he applied:</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>“Every student should have the chance to be taught by someone who represents them,” Rhys wrote in his application essay to Huston-Tillotson. “In order to build strong children, we need strong male teachers to forge a path through being the example for students. The baton has to be passed for us to continue pushing forward. I stand ready to run my leg of the race.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rhys is going to be a music educator and his first music classes at Huston-Tillotson were taught by Dr. Samuel Rowley, Rhys’ first Black male teacher.</p>
<p>Dr. Rowley noted that his life was “tremendously” impacted by his first Black male teacher. “We all wanted to be music teachers just like him.”</p>
<p>And Rowley was also very grateful for the Apple partnership and how it enabled remote learning over the last year:</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>“If it would not have been for Apple products, I would not have been able to connect with my students all around the country,” says Dr. Rowley, who is a recognized Apple Teacher after completing professional learning courses offered through the free online Apple Teacher Learning Center. He’s guiding Rhys and his fellow Pre-Ed Scholars through the courses as well, so they will also be recognized Apple Teachers when they graduate.</p>
