<p>Ahead of Apple launching the <a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/iphone-13/">iPhone 13</a> lineup in September, a new report from IDC projects that 2021 will be a strong year for the company’s smartphones when compared to the competition. While the overall market is set to grow just over 7 percent for the year, iPhone shipments are expected to almost double that.</p>

</p>
<p>Back in June, we heard that Apple hit the milestone of selling <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/06/30/iphone-12-crosses-100-million-unit-sales-marking-iphone-6-like-super-cycle/">100 million iPhone 12 devices</a>. Now with the iPhone 13 launch on the horizon, <a href="https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS48194821">IDC has more specifics</a> about how it thinks 2021 will end up for Apple’s smartphone shipments.</p>

</ul>
<p>The global smartphone market is projected to see a 7.4 percent increase in shipments for 2021 and Android is sitting below the average with IDC’s forecast of 6.2% growth. And the report highlights that <a href="https://amzn.to/3BomGzX">iPhone</a> could more than double Android’s annual growth rate at a strong 13.8%.</p>
<p>IDC notes 2021 smartphone shipments are still lagging due to the pandemic but countries like India, Japan, the Middle East, and Africa are helping boost sales.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The 7.4% growth can be attributed to a healthy 13.8% growth from iOS devices combined with 6.2% growth from Android. Although COVID-19 drastically impacted 2020 shipments, 2021 shipments have managed to display minimal growth compared to 2019 (pre-pandemic) volumes, giving us a more accurate view of the state of the market. The world’s largest markets – China, the United States, and Western Europe – will still be down from 2019, but growing markets such as India, Japan, the Middle East, and Africa are fueling the recovery.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>IDC also says that 5G remains a key selling point for upgrades which also means higher average selling prices:</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>5G shipments continue to be a primary driver of 2021 growth as both vendors and channels focus on 5G devices that carry a significantly higher average selling price (ASP) than older 4G devices. The ASP of a 5G smartphone will reach $634 in 2021, which is flat from $632 in 2020. However, 4G devices continue to witness a massive price decline as the ASP drops to $206, representing a nearly 30% decline from last year ($277). As a result, the total 5G shipment volume will grow to 570 million units, up 123.4% from last year.</p>
