<p>Tesla today reported its earnings for the second quarter of 2021, as detailed by our colleagues <a href="https://electrek.co/2021/07/26/tesla-tsla-releases-q2-2021-results/">over at <em>Electrek</em></a><em>. </em>During the accompanying earnings call this afternoon, Tesla CEO Elon Musk took a pair of jabs at Apple, criticizing the company over its App Store policy as well as its use of cobalt in iPhone and Mac batteries. </p>
<p><span id="more-740101"></span>
</p>
<p>During the earnings call, Musk was asked about Tesla’s plans to open its coveted <a href="https://electrek.co/2021/07/26/elon-musk-explains-tesla-open-supercharger-network/">Supercharging network to third-parties</a>. The Tesla CEO explained that the company’s goal is not to create a “walled garden” but rather to “support the advent of sustainable energy.” Musk hid his criticism of Apple behind a “cough.” </p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>“I think we want to emphasize that our goal is to support the advent of sustainable energy. It is not to create a walled garden and use that to bludgeon our competitors which is used by some companies.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>Musk then proceeded to fake a cough and mutter “Apple.” </p>
<p>Musk was also asked about Tesla’s supply chain during the call, leading him again to bring up Apple, as <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/26/elon-musk-snipes-at-apple-twice-on-tesla-earnings-call.html">noted by <em>CNBC</em></a><em>. </em>Musk explained that While Apple’s battery use is 100% cobalt, Tesla’s is much lower: </p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>“Apple uses I think almost 100% cobalt in their batteries and cell phones and laptops, but Tesla uses no cobalt in the iron-phosphate packs, and almost none in the nickel-based chemistries,” Musk said. “On on a weighted-average basis we might use 2% cobalt compared to say, Apple’s 100% cobalt. Anyway, so it’s just really not a factor.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Apple has faced criticism and questioning for its use of cobalt in the past. In 2019, a <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/12/16/child-labor-in-cobalt-mines/">report accused Apple</a> of “aiding and abetting” forced child labor in cobalt mines. Apple responded to the report by indicating that all the cobalt refiners in its supply chain participate in third-party audits, and that it removes any which fail or refuse. </p>
<p>Apple’s longer-term objective is to <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2017/04/19/apple-stop-mining-announcement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">eliminate the need for mining</a> altogether, by using only recycled materials. Experts say that this is a <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/03/07/a-mining-free-future/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">massively ambitious goal</a> that will not be practical anytime soon.</p>
<p>The criticism from Musk comes as Apple continues to move forward with its plans to build an electric car. A <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/06/10/apple-bmw-hire-electric-car-team/">report recently indicated</a> that Apple hired a notable ex-BMW executive who led development of the company’s i3 and i8 electric and hybrid cars. Apple has also hired a number of employees from Tesla over the years, leading Musk to at one point refer <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2015/10/08/elon-musk-apple-graveyard/">to Apple as the “Tesla graveyard.”</a> </p>
<p>Musk also <a href="https://electrek.co/2020/12/22/elon-musk-sell-tesla-to-apple/">remarked that he tried to sell</a> Tesla to Apple during the “darkest days” of building the Model 3, but that Tim Cook did not respond to his email. </p>
