<p>A judge last month gave provisional approval to a proposed <a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/apple-store/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple Store</a> bag check settlement, in which the Cupertino company has agreed to pay a four-figure sum to compensate employees in California for unpaid time waiting for off-the-clock searches.</p>
<p>Details of the settlement are now available on Apple’s website …</p>

</p>
<h2 id="h-background">Background</h2>
<p>We recently summarized the eight-year history of the case.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The dispute <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2013/10/14/apple-faces-class-action-lawsuit-from-store-employees-over-unpaid-time-waiting-in-line/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dates all the way back to 2013</a>, when retail staff complained at having to wait an extra 10-15 minutes after their shifts had ended in order to submit to bag searches and checks of their personal devices to protect against employee theft. Even Apple CEO <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2015/06/11/apple-store-security-checks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tim Cook expressed surprise</a> when he learned of this policy.</p>
<p>An <a href="http://9to5mac.com/2014/12/30/employee-lawsuit-security-dismissed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">initial class action lawsuit failed</a>, as did <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2015/11/07/apple-bag-check-lawsuit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a second one in California</a>, judges ruling that staff could choose not to bring bags and personal devices to work. However, the California Supreme Court reversed this, and <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2020/02/13/apple-retail-bag-search-ruling/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">told Apple that it must pay workers</a> for the time lost. One of the arguments the judge made was that Apple’s marketing described iPhones as an integral part of customer’s lives, and therefore tacitly admitted it was unrealistic for staff to leave theirs at home.</p>
<p>Apple discontinued bag checks in 2015, and earlier this year <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/11/13/apple-agrees-to-pay-workers-30-million-to-settle-lawsuit-over-bag-check-policy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">offered to pay workers $30M</a> (around $1,200 each) to settle the case.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A judge had to approve the settlement and <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/12/30/apple-store-bag-search-settlement-approved/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said that it wasn’t perfect</a> but would be allowed to proceed, with some small modifications.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>He demanded lawyers make the process for opting out of the settlement easier for class members. He insisted they drop requirements that class members use “magic words” to opt out. He further stated opts-outs should be accepted by electronic submission and not just mail.</p>
