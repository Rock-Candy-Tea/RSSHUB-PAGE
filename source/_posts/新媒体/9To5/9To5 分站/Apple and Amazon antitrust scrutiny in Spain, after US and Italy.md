<p>An Apple and <a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/amazon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Amazon</a> <a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/antitrust/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">antitrust</a> investigation has opened in Spain, following a similar one in Italy, and earlier concern in the US.</p>
<p>While the Spanish authorities don’t go into much detail, it seems likely this relates to the global deal reached between the two companies back in 2018, and follow-on developments to this … </p>

<h2 id="h-background">Background</h2>
<p><a href="https://9to5toys.com/2018/11/09/apple-and-amazon-deal-iphone-ipad/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple struck a deal with Amazon</a> in 2018 that provided the Cupertino company with <a href="https://amzn.to/368jOd4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an official Amazon store</a>. This meant customers could be confident they were buying from Apple rather than a third-party intermediary, while still benefiting from discounted prices on some products.</p>
<p>As part of this deal, sales of Apple products though Amazon Marketplace were restricted to Apple Authorized Resellers.</p>
<p>While the arrangement was touted as being safer for consumers, protecting them against counterfeit products and retailers of unknown standing, many legitimate resellers – especially of used products – said that <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2018/11/19/apple-resellers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this would cost them their livelihood</a>, and deprive buyers of significant cost savings. Only those selling millions of dollars’ worth of Apple products qualified for authorized reseller status.</p>
<p>An antitrust investigation into this arrangement <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2020/07/22/another-antitrust-investigation-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was opened in Italy</a>, encompassing both Apple and Beats products.</p>
<h2 id="h-apple-and-amazon-antitrust-investigation-in-spain">Apple and Amazon antitrust investigation in Spain</h2>
<p>Spain has now announced what appears to be a similar investigation. The Comisión Nacional De Los Mercados Y La Competencia (CNMC) description suggests it has the same concerns over the impact of the deal.</p>
<div class="page" title="Page 1">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<blockquote>
<p>The CNMC initiates disciplinary proceedings against Apple and Amazon for possible restrictive competition practices</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Both groups could have agreed to trade restrictions on the Amazon website in Spain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They would affect the retail sale of Apple products by third parties and the advertising of competing Apple products.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The behaviours could reduce competition in the Internet retail market for electronic products.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In addition, they could strengthen Amazon’s position in the sector of providing marketing services to third-party retailers through online platforms (Marketplace) in Spain.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The CNMC says there is evidence that the companies have broken two laws.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The CNMC has had access to certain information from which it can be concluded the existence of rational indications of the committing, by Amazon and Apple, of a breach of articles 1 of 2 Law 15/2007, of July 3, on the Defence of Competition (LDC) and 101 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The regulatory body has 18 months to complete its investigation.</p>
