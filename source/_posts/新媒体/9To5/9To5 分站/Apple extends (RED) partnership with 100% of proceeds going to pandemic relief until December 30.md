<p>As the pandemic is still a problem in many parts of the world, Apple is extending its partnership with (RED) and it will continue to redirect 100% of eligible proceeds of its PRODUCT(RED) devices and accessories to the Global Fund’s COVID-19 relief efforts from now until December 30.</p>

<p>Last year, Apple extended this COVID-19 relief effort until June 30, 2021. As vaccines are slowly rolling out across the globe and new variants of the disease have been discovered, this fund is more important than ever.</p>
<p>Apple updated its PRODUCT (RED) page in the US and around the world to note that all donations from sales of its PRODUCT(RED) lineup that normally go to helping fight HIV/AIDS will be temporarily redirected to pandemic relief (which will actually help keep HIV/AIDS programs alive).</p>
<p>In April of 2020, Apple and (RED) starting giving a <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2020/04/15/apple-donating-portion-of-productred-iphone-se-proceeds-to-covid-19-relief/">portion of eligible proceeds to the Global Fund for COVID-19 relief</a> but now it’s being bumped to 100% for about six months.</p>
<p>Here’s the <a href="https://www.apple.com/product-red/">announcement</a> that notes providing pandemic relief will help keep “lifesaving HIV/AIDS programs” going in Africa:</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p><em>For 14 years, our partnership with (RED) has led to almost $250 million in donations to fund HIV/AIDS treatment programs. Now through December 30, Apple is working with (RED) to redirect 100 percent of eligible proceeds from (PRODUCT)RED purchases to the Global Fund’s COVID‑19 Response. This will provide critical support to health systems most threatened by the outbreak and, in turn, help preserve lifesaving HIV/AIDS programs in sub-Saharan Africa.</em></p>
</blockquote>
