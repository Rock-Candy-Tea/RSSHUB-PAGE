<p>An Apple <a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/china/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chinese</a> New Year celebration features cartoon tigers dropping as you scroll down the Chinese homepage, in recognition of the year of the tiger…</p>
<p><span id="more-784380"></span>
</p>
<p>Specifically, it’s the year of the water tiger, as <em><a href="https://www.chinatravel.com/chinese-zodiac/tiger" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">China Travel</a></em> explains.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The Chinese zodiac tiger years come every 12 years as a cycle. </p>
<p>In Chinese element theory, each zodiac sign is associated with one of the five elements: Gold (Metal), Wood, Water, Fire, or Earth. 2022 is the Year of the water tiger.  Water tigers come every 60 years.</p>
<p>Chinese zodiac years are based on the Chinese lunar calendar which is around one/two months behind the Gregorian calendar.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The lunar new year begins tomorrow, on February 1.</p>
<p>If you visit <a href="https://www.apple.com.cn/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple’s Chinese homepage</a> and scroll down, you’ll see tigers dropping down the page and then flying away as you do so.</p>
<p>Apple has also posted a 23-minute long short film called <em>The Comeback</em> to its YouTube channel (which you can watch below).</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Kick off the Year of the Tiger with the story of a father, a son, and a forgotten village with an out-of-this-world dream. Apple and director Zhang Meng present their latest Chinese New Year film “The Comeback”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The film was, of course, <a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/shot-on-iphone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shot on iPhone</a>, though the small-print notes that the phone was supplemented by pro kit.</p>
<p>There’s also a short <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnA6ONhQ8OA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">behind-the-scenes video</a>.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>This Chinese New Year, join director Zhang Meng to reveal the magic of iPhone 13 Pro. Explore cinema-quality features of iPhone and a few simple filmmaking techniques behind the scenes of Apple’s latest Chinese New Year film. Then, it’s your turn to shoot your next big film with iPhone 13 Pro.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally, <em><a href="https://www.patentlyapple.com/patently-apple/2022/01/its-chinas-new-years-eve-and-apples-homepage-celebrates-the-holiday.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Patently Apple</a></em> spotted that Apple has launched a special edition AirPods Pro.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Apple also launched a special version of the AirPods Pro for the Year of the Tiger, priced at 1,999 yuan (US$314). Apple said that after the official design was first launched in the Year of the Ox, it continued to make a unique mark for the Year of the Tiger, bringing a special engraving on the AirPods Pro charging box, as well as an exclusive logo on the outer packaging.</p>
