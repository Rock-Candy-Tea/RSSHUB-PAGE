<p><a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/07/27/aapl-q3-2021-earnings/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Yesterday saw record AAPL Q3 earnings</a>, dramatically beating <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/07/26/aapl-q3-2021-earnings-expectations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">analyst expectations</a>, and Jason Snell has once again turned all the key numbers into beautifully easy-to-digest color charts.</p>
<p>Heading up the charts (above) is a breakdown of where that $81B revenue came from, with almost exactly half of it from iPhone … </p>

<p><a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/aapl/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AAPL</a> revenue was up 36% year-on-year.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Apple (AAPL) has officially reported its earnings for fiscal Q3 2021, covering the months of April, May, and June. For the quarter, Apple reported $81.43 billion in revenue, up 36 percent year over year, and profit of $21.74 billion. It reported earnings-per-share of $1.30. </p>
<p>This compares to the revenue of $59.7 billion and profit of $11.25 billion the company posted for the same quarter last year.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CFO Luca Maestri was in an understandably celebratory mood.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Our record June quarter operating performance included new revenue records in each of our geographic segments, double-digit growth in each of our product categories, and a new all-time high for our installed base of active devices. We generated $21 billion of operating cash flow, returned nearly $29 billion to our shareholders during the quarter, and continued to make significant investments across our business to support our long-term growth plans.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <em>Six Colors </em>chart shows this in historical context, complete with a four-quarter average line.</p>
