<p>Wireless standards continue to evolve, and while the <a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/iphone-13/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">iPhone 13</a> supports <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/iphone-13-pro/specs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wi-Fi 6</a>, Apple is expected to adopt the more advanced Wi-Fi 6e tech in the <a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/iphone-14/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">iPhone 14</a>. However, a new Ming-Chi Kuo report says that the company may find key components in short supply.</p>
<p>We previously outlined <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2020/07/25/wifi-6e/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the key benefit</a> of Wi-Fi 6e over the plain Wi-Fi 6 version … </p>
<p><span id="more-769715"></span>
</p>
<p>The executive summary is that there are certain radio bands that <em>only</em> <meta charset="utf-8">Wi-Fi 6e devices can use, meaning less congestion and faster speeds.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The best way I know how to explain it is to imagine if all <a href="http://electrek.co/guides/tesla">Tesla</a> cars had a road just for themselves. How much less traffic would you see on your commute? That is what Wi-Fi6e creates. It operates on the 6 GHz band so that no legacy devices can access it. Wi-Fi 6e devices will be able to work on Wi-Fi 6 and other previous standards, but no devices without 6e support will be able to access the superhighway. From a capacity standpoint, it’ll have access to 59 non-overlapping channels, so places like sports arenas, concert halls, and other high-density environments will provide much more capacity with less interference.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Apple is believed to be planning to take a lead in the adoption of Wi-Fi 6e.</p>
<p>However, Wi-Fi chips need components known as LTCC (Low Temperature Co-fired Ceramic), and the Wi-Fi 6e standard requires more of them. That, <a href="https://www.tfisec.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">says Kuo</a>, means that supplies will be short.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We […] believe that both the iPhone 14 and Apple head-mounted displays are equipped with Wi-Fi 6E, which is expected to drive more competitors’ products to adopt Wi-Fi 6E […]</p>
<p>The number of channels supported by Wi-Fi 6E is 2–3 times that of Wi-Fi 6. If it is a 3×3/4×4 MIMO design, each channel requires 2–4 LTCCs, so the LTCC usage of Wi-Fi 6E is 10-20 or more than that of Wi-Fi 6 […]</p>
<p>This will cause the LTCC supply to become tight again in 2022.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Apple’s lead may mean that it is already in the process of securing supplies ahead of most of its competitors, so it may be a repeat of existing chip shortages, where the iPhone maker is hit less badly than other companies. However, as we’ve seen, not even Apple is immune from industry-wide shortages, the company <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/10/28/tim-cook-says-supply-constraints-cost-apple-6-billion-during-q4-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">losing out on $6B worth of business</a> in the last quarter alone.</p>
