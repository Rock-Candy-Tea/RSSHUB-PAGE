<p><a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/aapl/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a> and other tech giants are using anti-<a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/china/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">China</a> lobbying as part of their attempts to fend off US <a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/antitrust/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">antitrust</a> legislation, according to a new report today.</p>
<p>The lobbying is being done via US foreign policy think tanks … </p>

<p>The <em><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/4e4ca1d2-2d80-4662-86d0-067a10aad50b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Financial Times</a></em> reports.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The world’s largest technology companies are pouring money into the biggest foreign policy think-tanks in the US, as they seek to advance the argument that stricter competition rules will benefit China.</p>
<p>Google, Amazon, Facebook and Apple are behind an increase in funding to four of Washington’s most prestigious research groups: the Center for Strategic and International Studies, the Center for a New American Security, Brookings and the Hudson Institute.</p>
<p>Total donations from Big Tech companies to the four think-tanks have risen from at least $625,000 in 2017-18 to at least $1.2mn in 2019-20, according to a Financial Times analysis of financial disclosures. These figures could be as high as $1.2mn in 2017-18 to $2.7mn in 2019-20.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The piece notes that the sums are small in absolute terms, but are still large enough to see tech giants rival oil and gas companies in their think-tank donations.</p>
<p>Apple’s attempts to block antitrust legislation have not been going well lately, despite CEO <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/01/18/apple-tim-cook-lobby-senate-antitrust/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tim Cook personally picking up the phone</a> to leading legislators.</p>
