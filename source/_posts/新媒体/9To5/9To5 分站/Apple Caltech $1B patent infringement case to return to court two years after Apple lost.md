<h2 id="h-background">Background</h2>
<p>The California Institute of Technology (Caltech) sued Apple back in 2016, claiming that Broadcom chips used in <a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/iphone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">iPhones</a> and other Apple products infringed on the college’s Wi-Fi patents. Caltech won the case in January 2020.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The jury sided with Caltech’s argument that the patented technologies were “key to keeping Apple competitive in the cellphone market.” The three Caltech patents at the heart of the case related to Wi-Fi performance and balancing speed with factors like heat, power, and chip size.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Apple said at the time that it would appeal, and <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2020/03/05/apple-caltech-infringement-case/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">subsequently tried and failed</a> to have the patents declared invalid.</p>

<p>However, it appears that the Cupertino company has now received the go-ahead to appeal the amount of damages awarded. <a href="https://twitter.com/DeItaone/status/1489605318074155018" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Walter Bloomberg</a> tweeted the news.</p>

<p>It has now been confirmed by both <em><a href="https://12ft.io/proxy?q=https://news.bloomberglaw.com/ip-law/apple-wins-new-trial-in-1-1-billion-caltech-patent-case" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bloomberg Law</a></em> (paywalled) and <em><a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/apple-broadcom-get-new-damages-trial-11-billion-caltech-patent-case-2022-02-04/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Reuters</a>.</em></p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Apple Inc. and Broadcom Inc. won a new trial on damages in a patent-infringement case over California Institute of Technology patents on Wi-Fi technology after a U.S. appeals court vacated a $1.1 billion verdict.</p>
<p>A two-tier damage award of damages of $270 million against Broadcom and $837.8 million against Apple that involved different royalty rates from each of the companies based on the same theory of infringement is “legally unsupportable,” the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled.</p>
<p>The court also affirmed the jury finding that Apple and Broadcom infringed two CalTech patents, but ordered a new trial [on the damages].</p>
