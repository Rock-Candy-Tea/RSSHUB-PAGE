<p>According to Vice-Chairman of Berkshire Hathaway Charlie Munger, the maker of the iPhone is “ungodly well-managed.” As Apple (AAPL) is now Berkshire Hathaway’s <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-is-ungodly-well-managed-berkshires-charlie-munger-says-181217016.html">largest stock holding</a>, Munger is continually impressed by its performance.</p>

</p>
<p>Despite ongoing supply chain issues, Apple saw record sales of iPhone, Mac, Watch, and its services in Q1 2022. In an <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2022/01/apple-reports-first-quarter-results/">Apple press release</a> last month, the company reported an all-time high revenue of $123.9 billion, up 11% year over year.</p>
<p><a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-is-ungodly-well-managed-berkshires-charlie-munger-says-181217016.html">Yahoo Finance</a> even reported it has sold a record-breaking $71.6 billion worth of iPhones. Its stocks have climbed 28% in the past year, soaring more than Google, Microsoft, and Amazon.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>“I judge the strength of the company based on how much the customers love it, [and] I’ve got zillions of friends who they’d almost part with their right arm before they’d part with their iPhone. That’s a hugely powerful position to be in.”</p>
<p><cite>Munger in an exclusive interview with Yahoo Finance</cite></p></blockquote>
<p>Munger’s interview comes as rumors are heating up about potential new products we’ll see this year. An Apple event is <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/02/04/apple-march-8-event-iphone-se-new-mac-ipad-air/">expected in March</a> where we could possibly see a new <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/02/05/5g-iphone-se-3-everything-we-know/">iPhone SE</a>, an <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/02/14/ipad-air-5-roundup/">iPad Air 5</a>, and <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/02/14/apple-registers-three-new-macs-in-eurasian-database-ahead-of-rumored-march-event/">three new Macs</a>. There’s a lot speculating to arrive in coming months and we’re on our toes waiting for announcements. </p>
