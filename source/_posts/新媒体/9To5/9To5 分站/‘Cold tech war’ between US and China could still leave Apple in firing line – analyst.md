<p>A “cold tech war” between the US and <a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/china/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">China</a> could still leave <a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/aapl/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a> in the firing line, argues Wedbush, even after the Biden administration rolled back some of the Trump-era policies.</p>
<p>President Biden this week <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/06/09/biden-us-app-security-exec-order/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revoked the scheduled US bans on TikTok and WeChat</a>, and has generally been taking a less aggressive stance with China, but there is still plenty of potential for trouble ahead … </p>
<p><span id="more-729471"></span>
</p>
<p>For example, in revoking the planned Chinese app bans, Biden replaced it with a more general executive order calling for a review of apps owned by China and other countries of concern, in order to protect US national security.</p>
<p>Additionally, <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/06/09/us-chip-production-52b/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Senate approved $52B in government funding</a> for US chip production, provoking an angry response from China.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p><span style="font-size: inherit;">Predictably, the Chinese government isn’t happy about it. Chinese lawmakers urged Congress to “immediately stop” progress on the bill, the official Xinhua News Agency reported Wednesday, citing a statement from a National People’s Congress committee that handles foreign affairs.</span></p>
<p>The bill “smears China’s development path and domestic and foreign policies,” the statement said, and “interferes in China’s internal affairs under the banner of innovation and competition.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://wedbush.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=d9fa1a1f-68da-4408-a453-aa12e98fc863&mime=pdf&co=wedbush&id=equityresearchdistribution@wedbush.com&source=9to5mac" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wedbush</a> says that the cold tech war could well heat up, and any retaliatory action by China is likely to hit Apple and Tesla hardest.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>While the current tensions have many implications for US companies/consumers, the two US companies disproportionately impacted by this Cold Tech War are clearly Apple and Tesla.</p>
<p>Apple has nearly all its iPhone production within China as part of its flagship Foxconn factory and Chinese consumers represent roughly 20% of all iPhones sold worldwide. Tesla on the other hand has built its flagship Giga factory in China with the country poised to represent ~40% of all global deliveries sold by 2022.</p>
<p>So far, the bark has been worse than the bite relative to the backlash and negative impact on both Apple and Tesla in China, however this remains a clear risk in the broader US/China brewing Cold Tech War.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Four members of Congress last month accused Apple of being “<a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/05/21/apple-is-a-pawn-in-chinas-malfeasance-say-four-members-of-congress/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a pawn in China’s malfeasance</a>.”</p>
