<p>Microsoft has announced today that it is acquiring Nuance Communications, the company that originally <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2014/06/30/why-is-apple-hiring-nuance-engineers-apparently-to-replace-siris-nuance-powered-backend/">built Siri’s backend</a>. With the $19.7 billion deal, Microsoft is looking to advance its AI and cloud capabilities in the healthcare industry – what Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella calls “the most urgent application.”</p>

</p>
<p>After creating the backend for Siri, rumors about Apple replacing Nuance’s tech with its own <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2013/07/26/apples-secretive-boston-office-working-on-siris-speech-recognition-perhaps-a-nuance-replacement/">started around 2013</a>. In 2014, details started surfacing about Apple <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2014/06/30/why-is-apple-hiring-nuance-engineers-apparently-to-replace-siris-nuance-powered-backend/">hiring Nuance engineers</a> as it worked to bring Siri in-house. And beyond Siri, Apple has also used Nuance tech in the past for speech recognition and speech-to-text features on the Mac.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/2021/04/12/microsoft-accelerates-industry-cloud-strategy-for-healthcare-with-the-acquisition-of-nuance/">press release</a> today, Microsoft announced what could be one of the biggest tech acquisitions of the year.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Microsoft will acquire Nuance for $56.00 per share, implying a 23% premium to the closing price of Nuance on Friday, April 9, in an all-cash transaction valued at $19.7 billion, inclusive of Nuance’s net debt. Nuance is a trusted cloud and AI software leader representing decades of accumulated healthcare and enterprise AI experience.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a tweet, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said the most important aspect of tech right now is AI and that healthcare is the “most urgent application.”</p>

<p>The acquisition of Nuance comes after Microsoft partnered with the company back in 2019 to augment its Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare.</p>
<p>Notably, while Apple is for now taking a bit of a different approach to improving health and healthcare than Microsoft, CEO Tim Cook has said multiple times that <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2020/01/20/tim-cook-ar-health-care/">Apple’s “greatest contribution” to mankind</a> will be health-related.</p>
<p>Along with Apple Watch being heavily health-focused, its new <a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/apple-fitness/">Apple Fitness+ service,</a> and more, Apple also has its Health Records integration up and running with over 500 health systems in the US, UK, and Canada.</p>
