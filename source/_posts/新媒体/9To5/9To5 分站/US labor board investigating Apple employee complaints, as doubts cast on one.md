<p>A US labor board is investigating two <a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/aapl/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a> employee complaints, one of which was filed by Ashley Gjøvik, a senior engineering program manager who has made a series of public allegations against the company.</p>



<p>However, doubts have been expressed about some of Gjøvik’s claims, including evidence that appears to disprove one of them … </p>



<span id="more-749882"></span><amp-ad width="300" height="250" type="adsense" data-ad-host="ca-host-pub-5506057612223327" data-ad-client="ca-pub-2445248216782983" class="unit-author m-at my-5 vpmd:mt-4 vpmd:mx-5 i-amphtml-layout-fixed i-amphtml-layout-size-defined" style="width:300px;height:250px" i-amphtml-layout="fixed"></amp-ad>



<h2 id="h-background">Background</h2>



<p>The controversy began when Gjøvik implied that Apple had responded to her allegations of sexism by <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/08/04/apple-engineering-manager-put-on-administrative-leave-after-complaining-about-sexism-at-work/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">placing her on administrative leave</a>. While she didn’t specifically state then that this was imposed by the company against her will, this was the very clear implication of her phrasing: that Apple was penalizing a whistle-blower rather than the offender.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>So, following raising concerns to #Apple about #sexism, #hostileworkenvironment, & #unsafeworkconditions, I’m now on indefinite paid administrative leave per #Apple employee relations, while they investigate my concerns. This seems to include me not using Apple’s internal Slack.</p></blockquote>



<p>A former Apple employee revealed that it was in fact Gjøvik herself who had <a href="https://twitter.com/_shantini_/status/1433297575914971136" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>requested</em> to be placed on paid leave</a>. Apple simply agreed to her request. In those screengrabs, we can see that Gjøvik claims she was ‘forced’ onto administrative leave.</p>

<amp-twitter width="600" height="480" layout="responsive" data-tweetid="1433297575914971136" class="twitter-tweet i-amphtml-layout-responsive i-amphtml-layout-size-defined" data-width="500" data-dnt="true" i-amphtml-layout="responsive"><i-amphtml-sizer style="display:block;padding-top:80%"></i-amphtml-sizer><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true" placeholder><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Finally, if anyone was looking for receipts, this is what set me off tonight. Such a big deal was made over this. <a href="https://t.co/ou3lR7u1V1">pic.twitter.com/ou3lR7u1V1</a></p>— Shantini is on vacation (@_shantini_) <a href="https://twitter.com/_shantini_/status/1433297575914971136?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 2, 2021</a></blockquote></amp-twitter>
</div></figure>



<p>It should be noted that Shantini herself left the company over its remote working policy, so has no incentive to defend Apple – indeed, she could well be feeling aggrieved. </p>



<p>The supporting evidence Gjøvik provided for her sexism allegations also appeared relatively weak. She <a href="https://twitter.com/ashleygjovik/status/1422380335703101443?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tweeted a screengrab</a> of positive iMessage feedback from a manager.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Feedback on the presentation today – I was specifically looking for tone. You did great. I didn’t hear you going up an octave at the end of your statements. Came across as much more authoritative. It’s super refreshing to provide feedback and then see you attempt to act upon it. Thank you!</p></blockquote>



<p>While it is well known that some male managers hold sexist attitudes about differences in tone between men and women, the feedback here would seem to apply to an employee of either gender. Someone who has a questioning tone at the end of their statements will indeed tend to sound unsure of themselves, and a number of Twitter users noted that this was extremely common feedback given to both men and women during public speaking training.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>I have received the same exact feedback in the past, as a male, from a female. I can relate to the feedback 100%.</p></blockquote>



<p>Gjøvik <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/08/04/apple-engineering-manager-put-on-administrative-leave-after-complaining-about-sexism-at-work/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">subsequently gave an interview</a> to <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/4/22610112/apple-female-engineering-manager-leave-sexism-work-environment" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Verge</a></em>, which made the whole dispute as public as could be. This was followed by <a href="https://www.ashleygjovik.com/ashleys-apple-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a webpage</a> on which she posted a mass of her tweets on the topic, including <a href="https://www.ashleygjovik.com/ashleys-apple-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a lengthy list</a> of the offences she believed her managers had committed (with some redactions):</p>

<h2 id="h-investigation-of-apple-employee-complaints">Investigation of Apple employee complaints</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/us-national-labor-relations-board-investigating-two-complaints-apple-workers-2021-09-02/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Reuters</a> reports that Gjøvik and another Apple employee have filed complaints with the US National Labor Relations Board.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>A U.S. national labor agency is investigating two charges against tech giant Apple Inc (AAPL.O) filed by employees, records on its website show, amid a wave of worker activism at a company known for its secretive culture.</p><p>The charges, filed on Aug. 26 and Sept. 1, are being reviewed by the U.S. National Labor Relations Board’s office in Oakland, California. The agency declined to comment.</p><p>“We take all concerns seriously and we thoroughly investigate whenever a concern is raised,” Apple, which is based in Cupertino, California, said in a statement that cited employee privacy in declining to discuss specifics.</p><p>Ashley Gjovik, a senior engineering program manager at Apple, told Reuters that she filed the Aug. 26 charge, which cites harassment by a manager, reduction of responsibilities and increases in unfavorable work, among other complaints.</p></blockquote>



<p>A separate complaint was filed by Apple engineer Cher Scarlett, who <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/08/23/apple-pay-survey-equity-and-inclusion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">carried out an internal survey</a> to determine whether there was a pay equity problem within the company. Around 2,000 male and female employees shared their seniority and salary. Analysis of the results showed a 6% disparity in male and female pay. <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/08/09/apple-bans-internal-employee-surveys-on-pay-equity-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple responded by banning such surveys</a>, which didn’t exactly help to allay concerns of unequal pay.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>The Sept. 1 charge was filed by Cher Scarlett, an Apple software engineer who said the company repeatedly stopped discussions of pay among employees.</p><p>The documents she sent the agency, which she provided to Reuters, say Apple “engaged in coercive and suppressive activity that has enabled abuse and harassment of organizers of protected concerted activity.”</p></blockquote>



<p>The reason many have opted to subtweet rather than respond directly is a fear that any expression of doubt about one individual may be misinterpreted as dismissing legitimate reports of sexism. To be clear on my own position, I have absolutely no doubt that sexism occurs within Apple as it does within any large organization. I don’t have the inside view necessary to hold an opinion on the seriousness with which the company attempts to correct these problems, but I do feel that responding to a survey which reveals pay disparity by banning such surveys is as dumb a response as a company could possibly make.</p>



<p><em>An earlier version of this piece included what appeared to be subtweet about this case, but has since been clarified to be a subtweet about another matter.</em></p>
