<p>Morgan Stanley and JP Morgan have both raised their price targets for <a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/aapl/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AAPL</a>, citing both continued strong sales of the <a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/iphone-12/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">iPhone 12</a> and expected high demand for the <a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/iphone-13/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">iPhone 13</a> – among other factors.</p>
<p>Morgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty has raised her target price for the stock twice in three weeks, most recently to $166 … </p>

<p><em><a href="https://www.ped30.com/2021/07/15/apple-katy-huberty-166/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PED30</a></em> saw the investment notes. Huberty notes the recent strong rise in the stock price, saying three factors explain it.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>First, there has been a general flight to quality big tech names in recent weeks, with AAPL, AMZN, FB, GOOGL and MSFT outperforming the S&P 500 by 8 points, on average, since early June.</p>
<p>Second, App Store growth accelerated in the month of June, to +17% (Exhibit 3), with most of the App Store’s largest markets showing a clear acceleration on both a Y/Y and 2-year stacked basis (Exhibit 4), supporting the view of secular services growth.</p>
<p>And lastly, iPhone supply chain data indicates iPhone builds are expected to grow at a mid-to-high teens percentage Y/Y in C2H21, which along with recent share gains further supports our view that iPhone revenue can grow in FY22, and refutes the concerns of iPhone s-cycle declines</p>
</blockquote>
<p>JP Morgan is even more optimistic, <a href="https://www.ped30.com/2021/07/15/apple-jpmorgan-target-175-poker/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">setting a $175 target</a> for the stock.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Apple supply chain analyst, William Yang, is increasing his iPhone build forecast for CY21 by 9 mn to factor in resilient demand for current/legacy iPhones, even as he maintains his build forecast for the upcoming iPhone 13.</p>
<p>We are increasing our iPhone volumes expectations modestly in conjunction with the raise to the build estimates, but more importantly, see a path to upside for the shares medium- term both on account of upside to iPhone 12 estimates as well as low investor expectations heading into the iPhone 13 launch.</p>
<p>The combination of upside from iPhone 13, stemming from a better upgrade rate to 5G devices and a larger installed base, as well as upside from the launch of iPhone SE3 in calendar 2022 could set Apple up for an earnings upgrade cycle over the next 6-12 months.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>AAPL has been enjoying <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/07/14/aapl-record-high-streak/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a streak of record-high stock values</a> as it nears $150.</p>
