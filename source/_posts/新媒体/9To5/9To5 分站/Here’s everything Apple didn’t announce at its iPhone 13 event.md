<p>Apple’s September event included the unveiling of <a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/iphone-13/">iPhone 13</a>, <a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/apple-watch-series-7/">Apple Watch Series 7</a>, the redesigned <a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/ipad-mini/">iPad mini 6</a>, and more. However, there were a number of things absent. Let’s look at everything Apple didn’t announce at its iPhone 13 event.</p>

<p>In an interesting turn of events, <a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/airpods-3/">AirPods 3</a> didn’t arrive at the iPhone 13 launch. Reports from the reliable Ming-Chi Kuo said to expect the new fully wireless earbuds in Q3 but it turns out that Apple may push them to Q4 this year or later.</p>
<p>AirPods 3 are expected to feature an all-new design similar to <a href="https://amzn.to/39dbVVq">AirPods Pro</a> but without the in-ear fit, keeping the “universal fit” of <a href="https://amzn.to/3EsHxEW">standard AirPods</a>.

<p>While the <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/09/14/ios-15-release-date/">iOS 15 official launch is set</a> for September 20, Apple didn’t share when to expect the next version of Mac software, <a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/macos-monterey/">macOS Monterey</a>.</p>
<p>With the new Macs in the pipe for Q4, we could see Apple hold off on launching Monterey until then. Notably, one of the operating system’s headlining features, Universal Control, still hasn’t been fully available to test in the macOS Monterey beta.</p>

<p>Very interestingly, the <a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/apple-watch-series-7/">Apple Watch Series 7</a> arrived without the all-new squared-off design that was reported by multiple sources.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/09/14/apple-watch-series-7-debut/">Apple Watch Series 7 debuts with similar design, larger display, faster charging, new colors, more</a></li>
</ul>
<p>In contrast, here are renderings of what was expected:</p>
<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-wp-embed is-provider-9-to-5-mac wp-block-embed-9-to-5-mac">
<div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</p></div>

<p>Along with keeping the same rounded design, there’s not a lot different with this year’s refresh other than a larger display and faster charging. It even uses what looks to be the same processor as the <a href="https://amzn.to/3CmAtaG">Apple Watch Series 6</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/09/14/apple-watch-series-7-has-the-same-processor-as-last-years-apple-watch-series-6/">Apple Watch Series 7 has the same processor as last year’s Apple Watch Series 6</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="wrap-up">What Apple didn’t announce wrap-up</h2>
<p>The all-new 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pro and upgraded Apple Silicon Mac mini set to arrive this fall will likely be the most anticipated releases. But AirPods 3 could ramp up the social phenomenon we’ve seen created by the existing models.</p>
<p>As for Apple’s entry into the AR/VR world, that’s not expected until 2022 or beyond.</p>
