<p>Back in 2018, Apple started cracking down on <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2018/12/05/apple-third-party-screen-time-apps/">third-party iOS parental control apps</a>. In the wake of that, the Russian Federal Anti-monopoly Service (FAS) investigated Apple and found the company <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2020/08/10/apple-guilty-russian-antitrust-investigation/">guilty of market abuse</a>. Now the official fine has been announced with Apple owing $12 million to the Russian government.</p>
<p><span id="more-716731"></span>
</p>
<p>One of the company’s to file a formal complaint that led to the Russian investigation was Kaspersky Lab. And the FAS concluded in August 2020 that “Apple Inc. limited competition in the market for iOS-based mobile apps and abused its dominant position with respect to the developers of parental control apps.”</p>
<p>At the time, Apple said it would appeal the ruling that demanded it “remedy the violations.” However, the specifics on what the remedy would be weren’t set.</p>
<p>Reported by <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/russian-competition-watchdog-fines-apple-12-mln-abusing-dominant-position-2021-04-27/">Reuters</a>, the Russian government has announced the fine will be $12 million (906.3 million roubles), a slap on the wrist for Apple but something Russia thinks will be “noticeable on financial statements.”</p>
<p>For its part, Apple says it previously helped Kaspersky get its apps back on the App Store.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>“We worked with Kaspersky to get their app in compliance with rules that were put in place to protect children,” Apple said in a statement. “They now have 13 apps on the App Store and we have processed hundreds of updates for them.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Anton Gorelkin, who is on Russia’s State Duma committee on information and communications also wrote something of a warning on Telegram:</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Gradually we are approaching the kind of seriousness in the conversation with Big Tech that has long been on display in the West.</p>
</blockquote>
