<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC), the world’s largest contract chip maker, said Wednesday that it had fired seven employees for violating the company’s “core values.”</p>
<p>Chipmakers didn’t reveal exactly why they fired seven employees, but local news media reported that affected employees leaked confidential information about orders from customers to outsiders.</p>
<p>In a statement, TSMC said it had fired seven employees at once, saying it issued an internal notice last week to inform the entire company of a move ahead of the long weekend of the four-day Mid-Autumn Festival that ended Tuesday. I confirmed the report.</p>
<p>TSMC said it had dismissed seven employees for failing to comply with employment norms and for improper behavior that “violated the company’s core values.”</p>
<p>“TSMC always operates on the company’s most important principles of integrity and integrity, so employees must follow these core values ​​when working for the company,” said Chipmaker stated.</p>
<p>“In the future, TSMC will continue to follow these principles and require all employees to do the same.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Around half of TSMC’s business is for Apple, as the exclusive fabricator of the company’s A-series and M-series chips. </p>
<p>Apple has been <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/06/24/apple-leaks-letter-crackdwon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cracking down on leaks</a>, including sending warning letters to prominent leakers back in June. We reported earlier that the iPhone maker was instigating <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/06/09/apple-doubles-down-on-secrecy-with-a-new-way-to-hide-ios-15-features-from-engineers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">additional precautions against leaks</a> from inside the company, applying initially to software but likely to be extended to hardware, too.</p>
<p>The Cupertino company uses TSMC exclusively due to its strong technical lead over rivals when it comes to fabricating chips using ever-smaller processes. Just a day after Intel acknowledged that it has fallen behind TSMC, and claimed it could catch up, TSMC <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/07/28/tsmc-2nm-production-set-for-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced its plans for 2nm chips</a>.</p>
