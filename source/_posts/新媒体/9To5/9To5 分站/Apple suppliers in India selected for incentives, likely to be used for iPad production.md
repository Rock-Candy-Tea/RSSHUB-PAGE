<p>Two <a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/aapl/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a> suppliers in <a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/india/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">India</a> have been selected to receive manufacturing incentives, which are likely to be used for <a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/ipad/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">iPad</a> production in the country. The scheme is known as a production-linked incentive (PLI) plan.</p>
<p><a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/foxconn/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Foxconn</a> and <a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/wistron/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wistron</a> were among the companies to qualify for cash-back deals in return for boosting their manufacturing operations in the country … </p>

<h2 id="h-background">Background</h2>
<p>We <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/02/24/ipad-production-in-india/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previously explained</a> the background leading up to the award.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Apple <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2016/12/20/apple-factory-india-wsj/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first sought financial incentives</a> to assemble iPhones in India back in 2016. The government <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2017/03/23/apple-iphone-factory-india-wistron/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said no to most of Apple’s requests</a>, but the company went ahead with local production plans anyway, <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2017/05/17/iphone-made-in-india-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">starting with the original iPhone SE</a>.</p>
<p>The iPhone maker did eventually get <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2017/05/23/apple-iphone-india-tax-concessions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one of the tax concessions</a> it had sought: the ability to import iPhone components into the country without paying any import taxes on them.</p>
<p>Apple continued to seek incentives for increasing the proportion of iPhones made in India, and the government last year announced a scheme designed to reward smartphone manufacturers for boosting production volumes. These incentives were <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2020/10/07/indian-manufacturing-incentives/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">worth between 4% and 6%</a> of the value of phones, depending on volumes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This new PLI scheme was <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/02/24/ipad-production-in-india/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">approved for tablets and laptops</a> back in February.</p>
<h2 id="h-apple-suppliers-in-india-among-pli-beneficiaries">Apple suppliers in India among PLI beneficiaries</h2>
<p><em><a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/india-selects-four-global-firms-boost-it-products-manufacturing-2021-07-01/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Reuters</a></em> reports that the Indian government has now announced the list of companies who qualify for the latest PLI scheme, and this includes both Foxconn and Wistron, alongside Dell and others.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>India on Thursday named Dell Inc, Wistron Corp and Foxconn as its choice of global companies in a $1 billion incentive plan to produce and boost exports of laptops, tablets and personal computers.</p>
<p>Ten Indian companies were also selected, including smartphone maker Lava and Dixon, which makes TVs for Xiaomi Corp (1810.HK) in India, the government said in a statement.</p>
<p>Under the plan, manufacturers get cash-backs of 1% to 4% of additional sales of locally made goods over four years, with 2019-2020 as the base year.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Apple has long been working on reducing its dependence on <a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/china/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">China</a> by expanding product assembly to a growing number of countries, with India heading the list. A range of iPhones are made in the country, and this latest incentive is expected to prompt the company to commission iPad assembly in India, too.</p>
<p>iPhone production in India was <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/03/11/wistron-resumes-iphone-production/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">disrupted for three months</a> following a riot by underpaid workers, while on a happier note <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/06/28/mac-sales-in-india-tripled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mac sales tripled</a> after Apple opened an official online store in the country.</p>
