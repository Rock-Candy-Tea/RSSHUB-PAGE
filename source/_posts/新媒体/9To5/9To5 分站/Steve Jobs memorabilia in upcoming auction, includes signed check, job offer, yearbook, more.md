<p>RR Auction has named the auction <em><a href="https://www.rrauction.com/auctions/auction-details/632?page=1&itemQty=96&view=gallery&sort=time&cat=0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Steve Jobs Revolution: Engelbart, Atari, and Apple</a>.</em></p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>RR Auction is proud to present one of our most significant themed sales to date—The Steve Jobs Revolution: Engelbart, Atari, and Apple.</p>
<p>Through documents and objects, this small, specially curated selection traces the history of personal computers—and, specifically, the advent of Steve Jobs and Apple as chief popularizers of such products.</p>
<p>Offered here are prototypes and early examples of some of the most innovative technologies ever conceived, including computer mouses developed by Doug Engelbart, Pong prototypes from the collection of its creator Allan Alcorn, and a sealed first-generation iPod.</p>
<p>Autographic highlights chronicle the life of Steve Jobs: a handwritten poem in a high school yearbook, his job application for Atari, an ultra-rare 1976 Apple Computer check for Apple-1 parts signed by Jobs and Woz, and a signed example of Macworld #1. Two lots include NFTs, the trendy new tech that takes the next step in connecting the physical and digital worlds.</p>

<p>Douglas Englebart was <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2020/08/03/william-english-the-man-who-built-the-worlds-first-mouse-passes-away/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the co-inventor of the mouse</a>, alongside Bill English, and it was he who first demonstrated it in 1968. If I had to pick one item from the auction to own, <a href="https://www.rrauction.com/auctions/lot-detail/345548906328001-douglas-engelbart-39-skeleton-39-early-mouse-with-x-y-axis/?cat=0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it would be lot 8001</a>: ‘Skeleton’ of an early Engelbart computer mouse, with signed patent diagram.</p>
<p>But it’s the signed Steve memorabilia which is likely to attract the greatest interest:</p>
