<p>The <a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/iphone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">iPhone</a> average selling price (ASP) hit double-digit growth last year, increasing 14% year-on-year. The popularity of the <a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/iphone-13/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">iPhone 13 </a>was the key driver, helping propel the global smartphone market as a whole to record annual revenue of $448B.</p>

<p>Market intelligence company <a href="https://www.counterpointresearch.com/global-smartphone-revenue-hits-record-450-billion-2021-apple-captures-highest-ever-share-q4-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Counterpoint</a> published its latest estimates today.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The global smartphone market revenue crossed $448 billion in 2021, according to the latest research from Counterpoint’s Market Monitor Service. It grew 7% YoY and 20% QoQ even as component shortages and COVID-19 restrictions continued to disrupt supply chains around the world.</p>
<p>Smartphone average selling price (ASP) grew 12% YoY to reach $322, mainly due to a higher share of 5G smartphones, which have a significantly higher ASP than the 4G models, as well as Apple’s successful launch of its iPhone 13 devices.</p>

<p>Apple took home 44% of total worldwide smartphone revenue, thanks to both high demand and an ASP that hit $825.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Apple’s iPhone revenue increased 35% YoY to $196 billion in 2021. It captured 44% of total global smartphone revenue in 2021.</p>
<p>The high demand for 5G-enabled iPhone 12 and 13 series helped Apple register 14% growth in its overall ASP, which reached $825 in 2021. The brand also managed to increase its share in key emerging markets such as India, Thailand, Vietnam and Brazil.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/samsung/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Samsung</a> was in a very distant second place, with total smartphone revenues of $72B, and an ASP of just $263. They were followed by Oppo (which now includes OnePlus), Xiaomi, and Vivo.</p>
<p>Counterpoint last month reported that <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/01/31/european-smartphone-market-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple overtook Samsung in Europe</a> to hit its highest ever market share in the region. While the average growth in the European smartphone market was 8%, Apple enjoyed a massive 25% rise in its share.</p>
