<p>This month has seen a streak of <a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/aapl/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AAPL</a> record-high values, the stock hitting three all-time-high closing prices so far, and looking set for a fourth when trading opens this morning.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, AAPL was showing $148.70 in pre-market trading, and looks likely to reach $150 any time now … </p>

<p>Apple at $145.64: Third record high of July. Set to open Wednesday morning with its fourth.</p>
<p>The chart [above] ranks the top thirty all-time high AAPL closing prices. Dates in green indicate closing price was an all-time high at that time. Thanks to <a href="http://aaplinvestors.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AAPLInvestors</a>‘ Terry Gregory, keeper of the stats.</p>

<p>While the stock could begin falling again before hitting $150, the one-month trajectory looks encouraging.</p>

<p>There’s been a mix of good and bad news for the company so far this month. On the plus side, Apple suppliers have been <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/07/05/foxconn-q2-earnings-up-20-percent/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reporting strong earnings</a>; tax breaks have been agreed for <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/07/02/apple-suppliers-in-india/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">making iPads in India</a>; and <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/07/12/apple-and-samsung-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a trio</a> of <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/07/12/idc-mac-shipments-continued-to-grow-in-q2-but-there-are-signs-of-a-slowdown/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">market intelligence reports</a> point to <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/07/13/mac-market-share-q2-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">very high demand for Macs</a>. On the downside, <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/07/09/epic-games-antitrust-case-australia/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">antitrust</a>, <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/07/09/apples-european-tax-increase-likely/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">taxation</a>, and <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/07/09/president-biden-executive-order-competition/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">right-to-repair</a> pressures continue.</p>
<p>But Apple itself seems optimistic, reportedly asking suppliers to <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/07/13/bloomberg-apple-asks-suppliers-to-build-90-million-iphone-13-units-by-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">produce 90 million iPhone 13 models</a> by the end of the year.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>As mentioned by the report, citing sources familiar with the matter, Apple usually orders about 75 million units of a new iPhone for its launch period, which usually runs from September-October to the end of the year. This year, however, the company wants to increase its production by 20%.</p>
<p>The main reason for ordering more iPhone units is that the company probably believes that this year’s phones will have stronger sales as the COVID-19 vaccination progresses around the world. This will also be the second iPhone update with support for 5G networks, which may push even more people to upgrade.</p>

<p>Apple is due to <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/06/30/apple-schedules-q3-2021-earnings-release-and-call-for-july-27/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reveal its calendar Q2/fiscal Q3 earnings</a> on July 27.</p>
