<p>This year we’ve seen Apple employees speak out about their negative experiences at the company and advocate for change publicly in a way we haven’t witnessed before. And after forming the <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/08/27/appletoo-stories-500-so-far/">#AppleToo movement</a> that picked up momentum earlier this year, the group has evolved with the latest effort being a walkout on Christmas Eve.</p>
<p><strong><em>Update 12/24 9:20 am PT:</em></strong> Apple Together has shared a specific list of demands for Apple this morning.</p>

</p>
<p>In a new tweet, <a href="https://twitter.com/AppleLaborers/status/1474414811261722629">Apple Together shared</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>We demand hazard pay</li>
<li>We demand healthcare premium coverage</li>
<li>We demand more accessible paid leave</li>
<li>We demand full-time benefits for part-time workers</li>
<li>We demand protections from abusive customers</li>
<li>For the pandemic
<ul>
<li>N95 masks for all</li>
<li>Sanitizer stations</li>
<li>Appointments only</li>
<li>No loitering</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s unclear how widespread the walkout/callout is today across Apple Stores, AppleCare, and more but you can keep an eye on people participating and supporting Apple Together with the Twitter hashtag <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/AppleWalkOut?src=hashtag_click&f=live">#AppleWalkout</a>.</p>
