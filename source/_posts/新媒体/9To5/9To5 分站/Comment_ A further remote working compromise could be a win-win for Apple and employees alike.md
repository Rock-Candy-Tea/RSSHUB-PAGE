<p>Companies large and small have had to rethink their office-based work plans, with many opting for a remote working compromise. <a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/12/02/google-office-jan-10-postponed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Google recently pushed back</a> its own return-to-office plans, and its own deal is similar to that of <a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/aapl/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a>, but with a bit more flexibility.</p>
<p>While Apple appears unlikely to have a major rethink about its stance, it did last month offer one additional concession, and it strikes me that extending this could be a win-win for company and employees alike … </p>
<p><span id="more-773012"></span>
</p>
<p>Apple and Google both have the same core policy: three days a week in the office, two days of remote working. <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/06/02/apple-hybrid-work-plan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple specifies the office-based days</a>: Mondays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays. Google says staff must be in the office for three days a week, but <a href="https://9to5google.com/2020/12/13/google-flexible-workweek-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">teams can agree among themselves</a> which days these are.</p>
<p><a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/06/04/apple-remote-work-letter-employees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Some Apple employees asked for greater flexibility</a>, including the option of full-time working from home where appropriate, but CEO Tim Cook was initially adamant that <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/06/29/apple-says-in-person-work-is-essential-and-will-not-go-back-from-its-hybrid-work-plan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the company would not budge</a> from its previously stated position.</p>
<p>Apple did offer one additional benefit: employees would – with the agreement of their manager – be able to take an additional two weeks a year of remote work. This was intended to allow staff to work while travelling, either visiting family and friends, or simply enjoying a change of scenery. </p>
<p>I made <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/07/16/apples-inflexibility-on-flexible-working/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the case for greater flexibility</a> back in July, but Apple made only one subsequent concession: the additional weeks of remote working was <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/11/18/apple-delays-return-to-in-person-work-to-february-will-allow-up-to-four-weeks-of-remote-work-per-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">doubled from two weeks to four</a>.</p>
<p>It’s here where I think there is scope for a further remote working compromise. Extending this offer to two months, or even three, could make disgruntled employees significantly happier about the deal, while still retaining the core three days a week the rest of the year.</p>
<p>I have personal experience of the value of this type of flexibility: I’ve worked from home for most of my life. I did get sucked into the corporate world for a little over a decade, but for most of my working life, I’ve had the freedom to work from wherever I wish.</p>
<p>To me, this is an absolutely <em>huge</em> benefit. First, because I adore my 10-second commute. But also because it allows me to travel while continuing to work. Pre-pandemic, I would take working holidays several times a year. I’ve visited cities as widespread as Buenos Aires, Boston, Cape Town, Las Vegas, Shanghai, Tokyo, and Vancouver, working in the mornings and holidaying in the afternoons (or vice-versa, depending on time zones). It means that I feel like I take a lot more vacation time than I actually do.</p>
<p>Extending the remote working benefit to two or three months would be a huge bonus for employees in terms of work-life balance. Some could use it to travel the country, or the world, enriching their lives that way. Others, who strongly value working from home, could enjoy that lifestyle for a decent chunk of the year.</p>
<p>Of course, the same riders I mentioned last time would still apply. There will be employees who need to be office-based most of the year, so some give and take would be needed on both sides. But those employees whose jobs can be done effectively from anywhere would get a considerable win, while still allowing Apple to protect its position of office-based work being the norm.</p>
<p>What’s your view? Could this be a good compromise, or should Apple stick to its guns? Please take our poll, and share your thoughts in the comments.</p>
