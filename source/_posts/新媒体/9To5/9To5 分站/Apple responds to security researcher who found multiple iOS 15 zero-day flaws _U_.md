<p>Apple overhauled its security bounty program back in 2019 by making it open to anyone, increasing payouts, and more. However, the program has seen a good amount of <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/09/09/apple-bug-bounty-program-complaints-reform/">criticism from the infosec community</a>. Now another security researcher has shared their experience claiming that Apple didn’t give them credit for one zero-day flaw they reported which was fixed and that there are three more zero-day vulnerabilities in <a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/ios-15/">iOS 15</a>.</p>
<p><strong><em>Update 9/27:</em></strong> After sharing his experience publicly, Apple has responded to security researcher illusionofchaos, aka Denis Tokarev.</p>

</p>
<p>Reported by <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/g5gan4/apple-still-investigating-unpatched-and-public-iphone-vulnerabilities">Motherboard</a>, here’s what Apple officially responded with, per Tokarev:</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>“We saw your blog post regarding this issue and your other reports. We apologize for the delay in responding to you,” an Apple employee wrote. “We want to let you know that we are still investigating these issues and how we can address them to protect customers. Thank you again for taking the time to report these issues to us, we appreciate your assistance. Please let us know if you have any questions.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Motherboard verified the email from Apple to Tokarev as legitimate by confirming it came from a server owned by Apple. Motherboard also asked for more feedback from those in the infosec community:</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>“While I’m glad Apple appears to be taking this particular situation more seriously now, it comes across as more of a reaction to bad press than anything else,” Nicholas Ptacek, a researcher who works for SecureMac, a cybersecurity company that focuses on Apple computers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile, another cybersecurity veteran said:</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>But the way Apple handled this whole process, given that its bug bounty program is more than five years old, “is not normal and should be considered normal,” according to Katie Moussouris, a cybersecurity expert who essentially invented the concept of bug bounties more than 10 years ago while she was at Microsoft.</p>
