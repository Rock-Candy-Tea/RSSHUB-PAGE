<p>An agreement has finally been reached on the scope of planned European <a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/antitrust/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">antitrust</a> legislation. It was previously unclear whether or not <a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/aapl/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a> would be included in the companies targeted, but it has now been confirmed that the definition will be broad enough to include the iPhone maker.</p>
<p>There had been significant disagreements about the appropriate targets for the EU’s planned Digital Markets Act (DMA). Some wanted it to be laser-focused on social networks like Facebook and Twitter, while others wanted it to target the very largest tech companies …</p>
<p><span id="more-769956"></span>
</p>
<p>However, the <em><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/045346cf-c28a-4f6f-9dce-4f8426129bf9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Financial Times</a></em> reports that a relatively broad definition of target companies has now been agreed.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The European Parliament’s main political parties agreed on Wednesday to a deal that would apply to companies with a market capitalisation of at least €80bn and offering at least one internet service, such as online search, according to four people with direct knowledge of the discussions.</p>
<p>It means the rules would draw more companies than thought into the EU’s planned Digital Markets Act (DMA), a wide-ranging effort to rein in Big Tech. Brussels hopes to implement the act next year.</p>
<p>Companies including Google, Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Microsoft would fall under its scope, alongside Netherlands’ Booking and China’s Alibaba.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Apple of course offers a growing number of online services, including iCloud, Apple Music, Apple TV+, Apple News, Apple Arcade, and Fitness+.</p>
<p>A vote will still take place in the European Parliament next week, but with all of the main political parties on board, this should now be a formality.</p>
<p>The primary risk to Apple relates to the App Store. In the US, a court has ruled that <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/09/10/apple-epic-games-ruling-statement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the App Store is not a monopoly</a>, but does have a dominant position in the marketplace, and so is subject to certain rules of fair play, of which the main one is to allow developers to steer customers to off-platform payment options. Within Europe, however, the “monopoly or not” question is <a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/antitrust/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as yet unanswered</a>.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Apple argues that it does not have a dominant position in this market, as it considers the relevant market to be either “smartphones” or “apps.” Since the company holds a minority share of the smartphone market in most of the countries in which it operates, it believes it cannot be considered to have a dominant position.</p>
<p>Competition regulators tend to take the view that the relevant market is “iOS apps,” and here Apple has a 100% monopoly on their sale and distribution. Edge cases aside, there is no way for a developer to bring an iOS app to market without selling it through the App Store.</p>
