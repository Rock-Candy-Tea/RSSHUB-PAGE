<p>As reported by <em><a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/iphone-maker-foxconn-make-chips-india-with-vedanta-2022-02-14/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Reuters</a></em>, Foxconn is trying to diversify its business due to the global chip shortage. Although it’s slowly getting better, the lack of semiconductors still haunts big tech companies.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>In a statement, Foxconn said it had signed a memorandum of understanding with oil-to-metals group Vedanta to make semiconductors, calling it “a significant boost to domestic manufacturing of electronics in India.”</p>
<p>Foxconn said it would invest $118.7 million to set up a joint venture company with Vedanta, which would be the majority shareholder of the new venture. Foxconn would hold 40% of the venture’s shares, it added.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This news comes just after Foxconn said it <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/02/10/component-shortages-easing-says-foxconn-expects-output-to-be-largely-unaffected/">sees signs of component shortages easing</a>, as it was planning for major improvements during the rest of the current quarter.</p>
<p>Although all companies suffered from the global chip shortage, Apple was one of the few that handle this crisis with ease. For example, the Cupertino company did manage a record holiday quarter, even though the component shortages <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/10/28/tim-cook-says-supply-constraints-cost-apple-6-billion-during-q4-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cost around $6B in lost sales</a> in <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/01/27/apple-forecasts-record-q2-2022-despite-continued-supply-constraints-and-covid-19-uncertainty/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">each of the last two quarters</a>.</p>
<p>Despite this, the iPhone maker <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/01/27/apple-forecasts-record-q2-2022-despite-continued-supply-constraints-and-covid-19-uncertainty/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shares Foxconn’s optimism</a> about this quarter.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>“We saw supply constraints across most of our products,” Apple CEO Tim Cook said in an interview Thursday as the company released its results. “We’re forecasting that we will be less [constrained] in March than we were in the December quarter.”</p>
<p>Apple should see year-over-year revenue growth in the quarter that runs January through March, he said, while remaining circumspect about when the industry’s supply issues will clear up long-term.</p>
