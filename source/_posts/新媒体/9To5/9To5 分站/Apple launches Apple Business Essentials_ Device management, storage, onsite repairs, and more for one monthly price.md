<p>“Small businesses are at the core of our economy, and we’re proud that Apple products play a role in helping these companies grow,” said Susan Prescott, Apple’s vice president of Enterprise and Education Marketing. “Apple Business Essentials is designed to help streamline every step of employee device management within a small business — from setup, onboarding, and upgrading, to accessing fast service and prioritized support, all while keeping data backed up and secure, so companies can focus on running their business.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Apple Business Essentials enable IT departments to configure settings and apps for individual users, groups, or stand-alone devices. When employees sign in to their business or personal device with their work credentials, the Collections feature automatically pushes key settings such as VPN configurations and Wi-Fi information. The new Apple Business Essentials app will be installed on each employee’s device, where they can download corporate App Store apps assigned to them. Apple Business Essentials allows access to a dedicated iCloud account for work, providing simple and secure storage, backup, and collaboration on files and documents.</p>
<p>IT managers can also enforce vital security settings such as <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/07/31/apple-work-filevault-2-is-so-good-theres-no-reason-for-it-departments-not-to-use-it/">FileVault</a> for full-disk encryption on <a href="https://amzn.to/3F6xu82">Mac</a>, and Activation Lock to protect company data if the devices are lost or stolen. If employees use a personal device at work, Apple’s User Enrollment creates cryptographic separation for their work data to keep personal data private while company data remains secure.</p>
