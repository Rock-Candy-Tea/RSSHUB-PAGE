<p><a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/aapl/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AAPL</a> stock options have been declared for <a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/tim-cook/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tim Cook</a> and five other Apple execs. The SEC filing shows that Cook is in line for more than half a million shares, worth $75M at current value.</p>
<p>Four other execs stand to receive shares worth $20M each, while another is in line for $2.25M … </p>
<p><span id="more-757473"></span>
</p>
<p>The Restricted Stock Unit award was declared in a series of Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) <a href="https://investor.apple.com/sec-filings/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">filings made yesterday</a>.</p>
<p>Part of the planned awards is performance-dependent, with execs judged on total shareholder return over the next two financial years. The number of shares declared are those that will be awarded if the shareholder return hits the targets set by the company. The filing notes that the actual performance-based awards can range from nothing at all to double the stated numbers.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Each restricted stock unit represents the right to receive, at settlement, one share of common stock.</p>
<p>[The] restricted stock units are scheduled to vest as to one-third of the units on each of April 1, 2024, April 1, 2025, and April 1, 2026.</p>
<p>[The] performance-based restricted stock units are scheduled to vest on October 1, 2024. The “target” number of restricted stock units is reported. Between 0% and 200% of the target number of units may vest based on Apple’s relative total shareholder return from the first day of Apple’s fiscal 2022 and ending with the last day of Apple’s fiscal 2024.</p>

<p>Cook last month received <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/08/26/tim-cook-set-to-receive-750m-worth-of-aapl-in-final-payout-from-10-year-pay-deal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a separate payout worth around $750M</a> from a 10-year performance-related deal struck when he became CEO.</p>
<p>As we’ve noted previously, Apple’s CEO plans to give away almost all of his wealth during the course of his lifetime.</p>
