<p>Today marks the beginning of the <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/05/02/epic-vs-apple-trial-starts-monday-heres-what-you-need-to-know/">three-week Apple vs. Epic</a> trial over the App Store. The trial, however, began in chaos as the call-in line was flooded with Fortnite and Apple fans alike after the court failed to mute the participants.</p>

</p>
<p>There is no live video stream of the Epic vs. Apple trial, but there is an audio call-in number listed on the United States District Court website. Ahead of the trial beginning this morning, the call-in phone line was flooded by Apple and Fortnite fans arguing over the case’s outcome.</p>
<p>One of the most prominent chants during the call was loyal Fortnite fans screaming “free Fortnite.” <em><a href="https://venturebeat.com/2021/05/03/apple-vs-epic-starts-out-with-hilarious-chatter-from-the-audience/">VentureBeat</a></em> has a good recap of some of the other best moments of the call:</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>“I’m going to tell my mom just don’t pick up the line,” said one audience member.</p>
<p>Another said, “Tim Sweeney better know what he’s doing. If he messes up once, we won’t have iOS back. This call is live, by the way.”</p>
<p>Then someone said, “They screwed up and lost their app on iOS.”</p>
<p>One person chanted, “Epic Games! Epic Games!”</p>
<p>One listener became a commentator, saying the trial is expected to last three weeks. Another started playing Travis Scott, who held a concert in Fortnite that was attended by tens of millions of people.</p>
<p>“We just want mobile back,” said another. “I’m so poor I can’t afford mobile.”</p>
<p>There was a lot of cursing.</p>
<p>At one point, there were dozens of people trying to talk at once. One person promoted his YouTube channel. Another sang the praises of auto-aiming on mobile.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ultimately, the court finally figured out how the phone system works, and everyone was muted. “I think we’ve got the phone lines under control. It will not be a problem in the future,” federal judge Yvette Gonzalez Rogers said.</p>
<p>The Epic vs. Apple trial will <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/05/02/epic-vs-apple-trial-starts-monday-heres-what-you-need-to-know/">run for three weeks</a>. It officially begins today with opening remarks, and we’ll have full coverage right here on <em>9to5Mac.</em> You can find instructions on how to <a href="https://cand.uscourts.gov/cases-e-filing/cases-of-interest/epic-games-inc-v-apple-inc/">listen along here</a>. </p>
