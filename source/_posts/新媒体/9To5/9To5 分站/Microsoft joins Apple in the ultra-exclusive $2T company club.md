<p><a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/microsoft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Microsoft</a> has become the second US public company to join what was previously an <a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/aapl/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a> exclusive: <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2020/08/19/apple-2-trillion-market-cap-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the $2T company club</a> … </p>

<p><em><a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/microsoft-joins-apple-in-2-trillion-market-cap-club/#ftag=CAD590a51e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CNET</a></em> reports that the company’s achievement was rather brief.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The company hit the threshold as shares rose as much as 1.2% before sliding back a little to close at $265.51, up 1.1%, and giving the company a closing market cap of $1.99 trillion. The milestone comes two years after the company surpassed the $1 trillion market cap mark.</p>
<p>Microsoft hit the lofty market cap roughly 10 months after fellow tech giant Apple hit the mark in August 2020. Apple currently has a market cap of $2.23 trillion.</p>
<p>Oil company Saudi Aramco, which trades on the Saudi Tadawul exchange, surpassed the $2 trillion mark on its second day of trading in 2019 but had a market cap of $1.88 trillion on Tuesday […]</p>
<p>In April, Microsoft posted a third-quarter profit of $14.8 billion, up 38% from the same period last year. Revenue for the quarter was up 19%.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, it would take only the smallest upward movement to restore its membership, so we can expect the position to be permanent within a day or so.</p>
<p>As with Apple, Microsoft has found itself a beneficiary of the pandemic. Working from home has driven demand for the company’s hardware, especially <a href="https://amzn.to/2UpRXlT" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Surface range</a>. A greater need for home entertainment has also helped <a href="https://amzn.to/3zTsYYr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox</a> sales. But the greatest impact was likely increased use of the company’s software and cloud computing services.</p>
<p>While COVID-19 may have sped up demand, Microsoft believes that the underlying trend will continue.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>“Over a year into the pandemic, digital adoption curves aren’t slowing down,” Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said in a statement at the time. “They’re accelerating, and it’s just the beginning.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Amazon and Google are the top contenders to join the $2T club next.</p>
