<p>Wedbush analyst Dan Ives has said that now would be a good time to buy <a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/aapl/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AAPL</a>, naming it as the best investment among tech stocks that could climb 25-30% by the year end.</p>
<p>Wedbush recommends three tech stocks that offer a “compelling risk/reward” ratio … </p>

<p><em><a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/apple-microsoft-nuance-communications-top-3-tech-stocks-earnings-wedbush-2021-4-1030281706" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Business Insider</a></em> reports:</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Apple, Microsoft, and Nuance Communications are the top three tech buys heading into earnings season, according to Wedbush.</p>
<p>In a note to clients on Wednesday, analyst Dan Ives said that he believes tech stocks have “an upward 25%-30% move in the cards the rest of the year despite lingering rotation fears.”</p>
<p>The analyst laid out his top picks for a “compelling risk/reward” heading into earnings season. Apple, Microsoft, and Nuance Communications topped the list.</p>
<p>Ives highlighted Apple as his first top buy on Wednesday and said that the “supercycle thesis” for iPhone sales looks to be playing out.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The analyst still projects total fiscal 2021 iPhone sales in the 240-250M range, a number he first pitched in January and which is significantly higher than the Wall Street consensus of 220M.</p>
<p>The Microsoft recommendation is based on the company apparently winning cloud services business from Amazon.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The Redmond-based tech giant posted 50% growth in its Azure cloud business in the latest quarter compared to AWS’ 28% figure.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Cloud and AI tech also underlies the Nuance case.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Ives said Nuance Communications is set to benefit from more “hospital-wide deployments” of its cloud and AI technology which are “playing out and gaining further momentum based on our checks.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Morgan Stanley issued <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/04/06/apple-services-growth/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an investment note yesterday</a> that downgraded its price target for AAPL, though still classing it as a buy.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Apple Services revenue is still growing strongly, says Morgan Stanley, but the performance of some of its competitors shows that the market is a tough one. The bank has downgraded its price target for AAPL from $164 to $156.</p>
