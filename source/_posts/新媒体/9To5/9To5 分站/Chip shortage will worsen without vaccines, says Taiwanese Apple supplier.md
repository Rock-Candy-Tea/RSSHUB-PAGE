<p>A Taiwanese Apple supplier has warned that the global chip shortage will worsen without a massive increase in <a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/coronavirus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">COVID-</a>19 vaccinations on the island.</p>
<p>The comment was made as the world’s leading chip testing company was forced to suspend production following a COVID-19 outbreak … </p>

<p>Taiwan was initially hardly touched by the pandemic, thanks to tight travel restrictions and a world-beating contact-tracing system. However, infections are now rising exponentially in the country.</p>
<p><em><a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Tech/Semiconductors/Taiwan-chip-supplier-halts-production-due-to-COVID-cluster" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nikkei Asia</a></em> reports.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>A leading Taiwanese semiconductor supplier will suspend all domestic production for two days after reporting a COVID infection cluster, risking the continuity of the island’s crown-jewel chip supply chain at a time of a global shortage.</p>
<p>King Yuan Electronics, the world’s leading chip testing service provider, said it will suspend production at sites in Miaoli and Hsinchu — the hub of the island’s chip industry — that account for around 80% of its revenue […] KYEC’s production suspension could aggravate the global chip shortage, which has already hit a swath of players from automobile makers to consumer electronics giants.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So far, only around 2.5% of the population has received a first COVID-19 vaccination shot, and that percentage needs to rise dramatically, says one Apple supplier.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>“If the majority of the population in Taiwan do not receive COVID vaccines soon, I fear it is only a matter of time until more and more companies will be forced to halt production due to the spread of the virus,” an Apple supplier executive told Nikkei Asia.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Apple was recently reported to be <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/05/24/apple-helping-tsmc-vaccines/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">helping TSMC vaccinate its workforce</a>.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Apple is helping A-series and M1 chipmaker <a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/tsmc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TSMC</a> get COVID-19 vaccines for its employees after an appeal for help from the Taiwanese government, according to a new report […] helping to obtain Pfizer or Moderna vaccines for TSMC and employees’ families […]</p>
<p>TSMC is a vital supplier for Apple, and any reduction in its output could have dramatic consequences for the supply of almost every Apple product, from Apple Watch to Mac.</p>
