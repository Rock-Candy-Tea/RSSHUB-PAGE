<p>UBS affirms the Apple stocks represent a potential 18% surge in the value of its share over the next 12 months, despite the lack of an iPhone supercycle. AAPL stock is currently down 15% from the high in January, and UBS paints this as a great time to buy: </p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>UBS analysts David Vogt and Munjal Shah said in a note to clients on Wednesday investors should consider taking a bite of ‘the big Apple’ given the drop in its share price. Apple stocks are down nearly 15% from their late January highs. The analysts said iPhone demand ‘should be relatively stable in line with historic demand trends’ and argued a ‘supercycle is unlikely to materialize’ but the team wasn’t fazed by the lagging iPhone sales.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The analysts have also “raised their fiscal year 2021 iPhone sales estimate by 5 million to 220 million, due to improved 5G demand in China,” but it’s still below what some other analysts estimated at around 240 million units sold.</p>
<p><a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/03/31/aapl-q2-2021-earnings-date-announced/">Apple also scheduled its Q2 2021 earnings release and call for April 28</a>. The earnings report comes after the company reported a record-breaking holiday quarter in January, with $111.44 billion in revenue and a profit of $28.76 billion. </p>
