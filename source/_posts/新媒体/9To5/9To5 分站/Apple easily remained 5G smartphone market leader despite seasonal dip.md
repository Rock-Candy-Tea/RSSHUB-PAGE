<p>Apple comfortably retained its position as <a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/5g/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">5G</a> smartphone market leader in the first quarter of this year, despite the seasonal dip after the combined launch and holiday quarter.</p>
<p>All <a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/iphone-12/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">iPhone 12</a> launch sales were in the final quarter of last year, with the iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Pro <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2020/10/22/iphone-12-pre-orders-arriving/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">going on sale in October</a>, and the iPhone 12 mini and Pro Max <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2020/11/06/iphone-12-mini-iphone-12-pro-max-orders/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the following month</a> …</p>

</p>
<p>Although the new models continued to sell well into this year, two factors did see Apple’s share of the 5G smartphone market drop off in the first quarter.</p>
<p>First, the seasonal dip after launch and holiday sales. <a href="https://news.strategyanalytics.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2021/Strategy-Analytics-Samsung-and-Vivo-are-Worlds-Fastest-Growing-5G-Smartphone-Vendors-in-Q1-2021/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Strategy Analytics</a> reports a 23% quarter-on-quarter fall from 52.2M shipments in Q4 2020 to 40.4M in the first quarter of this year.</p>
<p>Second, the launch of new competing Android models. All four of the next-largest 5G smartphone brands saw significant increases in their shipments across the same time period, says the market intelligence firm.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Samsung was the world’s fastest growing 5G smartphone vendor in Q1 2021, leaping 79% QoQ to 17 million units shipped. Samsung is performing well with new 5G models, such as Galaxy S21 5G, S21 ultra 5G and S21+ 5G, in South Korea, North America, and parts of Europe.</p>
<p>Vivo was the second fastest growing 5G smartphone vendor in Q1 2021, jumping 62% QoQ to 19 million units shipped, driven by its iQOO U3 5G and U7 5G smartphones. Vivo’s 5G smartphone strongholds are China and Europe.</p>
<p>OPPO grew 55% QoQ, and Xiaomi increased 41% QoQ, both due to solid volumes at home in China.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Apple dipped 23% QoQ, following a blowout Q4 2020 where the new 5G iPhone was wildly popular as a gift during the holiday season.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, nobody challenged Apple’s position as 5G smartphone market leader, the company ending up with a 29.8% market share – close to twice that of second-placed Oppo, at 15.8%.</p>
