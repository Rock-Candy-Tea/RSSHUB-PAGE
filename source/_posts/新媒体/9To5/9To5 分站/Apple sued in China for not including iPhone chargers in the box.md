<p><a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/aapl/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a> is being sued in <a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/china/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">China</a> for failing to include <a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/iphone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">iPhone</a> chargers in the box. The report says that the lawsuit has been put forward for ‘public interest’ status, suggesting that it could be fast-tracked or given a higher profile.</p>
<p>It follows a consumer protection fine in Brazil for the same issue, and Apple being forced to continue to supply EarPods with iPhones in France … </p>

</p>
<h2 id="h-background">Background</h2>
<p>Apple has historically included both a charging brick and a pair of EarPods in the box with every new iPhone sold. <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2020/10/13/iphone-12-does-not-come-with-power-charger-or-earbuds-in-the-box/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">That ended last year</a>, with Apple choosing to omit both items from the iPhone 12 box, citing <a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/environment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">environmental</a> reasons.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>For the first time, neither the power charger brick nor the Apple EarPods will be included with your iPhone purchase. Apple says doing this will save 2 million metric tons of carbon annually.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While some accepted Apple’s reasoning, others accused the company of making the decision to save money and sell more accessories.</p>
<p>In Brazil, <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/03/20/brazil-agency-fines-apple-iphone-12-charger/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple fell foul of the consumer protection regulator</a>, and was fined $2M “for misleading advertising, selling a device without the charger and unfair terms.” In France, the company was forced to <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/09/30/apple-iphone-13-earpods-france/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">adopt a box-within-a-box solution</a> to continue to provide EarPods <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/08/22/iphone-7-radiation-safety/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to comply with safety laws</a>.</p>
<h2 id="h-iphone-chargers-lawsuit">iPhone chargers lawsuit</h2>
<p><em><a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/m7vqmb/apple-sued-china-iphone-chargers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Vice</a></em> reports.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>A group of Chinese university students have filed a lawsuit against Apple, demanding the company provide a charger for an iPhone they bought […]</p>
<p>The plaintiffs argued that Apple was only using environmental concerns as an excuse to promote its MagSafe chargers […]</p>
<p>The students from Beijing and Shanghai sought to challenge the [environmental] argument in court, according to a <a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/z4w89z7vhGdeTY2algqlYw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">report</a> by <em>Shanghai Law Journal</em>. They demanded Apple provide a wall charger for an iPhone 12 Pro Max purchased by one student, pay 100 yuan ($16) for breach of contract, and cover the legal fees. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although the lawsuit targets the <a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/iphone-12/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">iPhone 12</a>, any ruling would of course apply to the <a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/iphone-13/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">iPhone 13</a> and subsequent models.</p>
<p>Interestingly, one argument is that the cable on its own is no good because it’s a USB-C one, and while everyone has USB-A chargers, not everyone has a USB-C one.</p>
<p>The case is now awaiting further information from both the students and Apple.</p>
<p>Apple is also facing legal pressure in Europe <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/09/23/eu-usb-c-iphone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to switch from Lightning to USB-C</a>, but the timescales involved are such that the company will either have done that or switched to portless iPhones, <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/08/13/iphone-with-usb-c-port-law/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">before the law comes into effect</a>.</p>
