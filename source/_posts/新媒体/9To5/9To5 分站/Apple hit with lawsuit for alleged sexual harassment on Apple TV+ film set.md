<p>In a report from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-17/apple-sued-for-failing-to-stop-sexual-harassment-on-film-set"><em>Bloomberg</em></a><em>,</em> Apple is facing a lawsuit by a woman working on the set of the upcoming film <em>Emancipation</em>. <em>Emancipation</em> is an upcoming thriller on <a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/apple-tv/">Apple TV+</a> starring Will Smith. </p>

</p>
<p>Alicia Kelly claims the Cupertino company did not do anything to protect her from sexual harassment while working in a COVID-19 support role on set. </p>
<p>Kelly is suing Lionsgate Entertainment Inc. and Jerry Bruckheimer Inc. as well. She claims the companies aided a workplace that allowed sexual harassment against female workers. She was hired in October 2020 as a testing coordinator for the<em> Hightown</em> TV series. This is where Kelly says the sexual harassment began. </p>
<p>When working on<em> Emancipation </em>in New Orleans and Georgia, Kelly says her boss sexually assaulted her in a hotel. According to her complaint, her boss continued to sexually harass her during this time. </p>
<p>Kelly stated both companies “had a duty to exercise reasonable care in the supervision of its subsidiaries, contractors, sub-contractors, and their employees.” Both failed to comply. </p>
<p>Neither Apple or Lionsgate commented on the lawsuit. However, Lionsgate made a statement that it has zero tolerance for sexual harassment at its productions. It takes all claims of harassment seriously and investigates each situation closely.</p>
<p>According to <em>Bloomberg, </em>neither Apple nor Jerry Bruckheimer Inc. immediately responded to a request for comment. </p>
