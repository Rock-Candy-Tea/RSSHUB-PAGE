<p>Apple had a busy year in 2021, announcing the iPhone 13 lineup, new Apple Silicon-powered Macs, and more. Looking ahead to 2022, there’s still a lot to expect from the company. In the latest edition of his <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/account/newsletters/power-on"><em>Power On </em>newsletter, <em>Bloomberg’s </em>Mark Gurman</a> breaks down everything he expects Apple to unveil in the new year. </p>

</p>
<p>In today’s newsletter, Gurman corroborates much of what has previously been reported about what to expect from Apple in 2022. Notably, he still says that Apple is planning a <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/06/04/ipad-pro-redesign-glass-back-wireless-charging/">new iPad Pro design</a> with support for wireless charging, as well as updates to the lower-end iPad Air and entry-level iPad. </p>
<p>Gurman also says that Apple has a redesigned MacBook Air in the works for 2022, alongside a “revamped, high-end iMac with Apple Silicon.” There’s also a new entry-level MacBook Pro, a new Mac Pro, and a new Mac mini in the works for next year. </p>
<p>For the Apple Watch, Gurman expects three new models, including an updated Apple Watch SE, an updated standard model, and a “<a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/03/26/bloomberg-apple-considering-new-apple-watch-model-with-rugged-casing-aimed-at-athletes/">ruggedized version</a> aimed at extreme sports athletes.” </p>
<p>“2021 was a modest year for Apple product updates, but I’d expect a wider-range of new products in 2022. Let’s go down the list of what I expect to come next year,” Gurman says. Here’s the full breakdown of everything to expect from Apple in 2022, according to Gurman: </p>
<ul>
<li>A new iPad Pro design with wireless charging, plus updates to the iPad Air and entry-level iPad. </li>
<li>A revamped, high-end iMac with Apple silicon to sit above the new 24-inch model.</li>
<li>An iPhone SE with 5G.</li>
<li>New AirPods Pro earbuds.</li>
<li>The biggest MacBook Air revamp in the product’s history, adding the M2 chip and a new design. </li>
<li>New versions of the Mac mini, entry-level MacBook Pro and a revamped Mac Pro with Apple silicon.</li>
<li>Of course, the iPhone 14 lineup. </li>
<li>Three fresh Apple Watches, including a new Apple Watch SE, an updated standard model, and a ruggedized version aimed at extreme sports athletes. </li>
<li>And, probably most significantly, the introduction of Apple’s first mixed augmented and virtual reality headset. </li>
</ul>
<p>If all of this ends up panning out, it’s clear that Apple has quite a bit in the works for 2022. What are you most excited to see? Let us know down in the comments!</p>
