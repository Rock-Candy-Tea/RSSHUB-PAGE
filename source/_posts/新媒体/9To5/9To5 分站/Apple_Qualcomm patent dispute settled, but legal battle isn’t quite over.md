<p>That’s because there was an ongoing <a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/qualcomm/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Qualcomm</a> appeal relating to one of the patents challenged by Apple, and that case has quietly rumbled on in the background … </p>

</p>
<h2 id="h-background">Background</h2>
<p>Apple bought modem chips from Qualcomm for its iPhones. These modems contained patented technology, and the chipmaker charged Apple both for the chips themselves and a separate license fee for use of the patented tech. The iPhone maker objected to this as “double-dipping.”</p>
<p>There had seemed no prospect of a settlement as each company became increasingly aggressive in its stance.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Qualcomm had <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2017/05/25/qualcomm-apple-lawsuit-injunction-suppliers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">accused Apple of blackmail</a>. The CEOs of the two companies <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/04/13/apple-qualcomm-ceo-meeting/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">had ‘hostile’ meetings</a>. Qualcomm <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/01/14/qualcomm-apple-battle-iphone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">refused to sell chips</a> to Apple for the iPhone XS and XR. Both companies set aside earlier talk of settlement and pledged to fight it all the way.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/04/15/apple-versus-qualcomm/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">multibillion-dollar</a> trial began – then unexpectedly ended on day one when the two companies reached <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/04/16/apple-qualcomm-settlement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an out-of-court settlement</a>.</p>
<p>No explanation was offered – but the settlement was almost certainly at the request of Apple after <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/04/17/apple-qualcomm-and-intel/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it was effectively left with no choice</a> but to repair its relationship with Qualcomm <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/04/16/intel-leaves-5g-modem-business/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">when Intel exited</a> the 5G smartphone modem business.</p>
<h2 id="h-apple-qualcomm-patent-dispute-lives-on">Apple/Qualcomm patent dispute lives on</h2>
<p>However, Qualcomm was still unhappy that one of its patents was declared invalid, and continued to pursue that aspect. <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/transactional/apple-faces-court-setback-smartphone-patent-fight-with-qualcomm-2022-02-01/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Reuters</a> reports that the chipmaker has succeeded in getting the matter reopened.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Chipmaker Qualcomm Inc got another chance Tuesday to show that one of its smartphone-chip patents challenged by Apple is valid, setting up another round of arguments before a key U.S. patent tribunal.</p>
<p>The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit said the Patent Trial and Appeal Board may have wrongly relied on part of Qualcomm’s own patent to find that it was invalid […] The court sent the case back to the Patent Trial and Appeal Board.</p>
