<p>Key iPhone assembler <a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/foxconn/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Foxconn</a> has echoed <a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/aapl/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple’s</a> chip shortage warning that production will be hit this quarter, saying that the lead time for some chips is now anything up to a year.</p>
<p>Apple said during its last earnings call that although the impact on iPhone production would be limited, it did expect <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/04/28/apple-supply-shortages-ipad-mac/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shortages of iPads and Macs</a> … </p>

<h2 id="h-background">Background</h2>
<p>Factory shutdowns around the world during the pandemic have lead to a huge backlog in chip production, most notably in mundane but vital components like display drivers.</p>
<p>iPhone production has been relatively unaffected because Apple commissions its own A-series chips from TSMC, and is such an important client that it is able to negotiate priority from suppliers of other components – including, in some cases, entire production lines dedicated to the Cupertino company.</p>
<p>However, even Apple is not immune, and CFO Luca Maestri said the impact this quarter was <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/04/28/apple-supply-shortages-ipad-mac/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">likely to be significant</a>.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Maestri told investors on the conference call that the constraints could cost the company somewhere to the tune of $3 billion to $4 billion in revenue for the fiscal third quarter. Despite this, Maestri said that Apple predicts revenue for the quarter to grow by “strong double digits” year-over-year. “We wish we had more inventory of iPad and Mac,” Maestri added.</p>
