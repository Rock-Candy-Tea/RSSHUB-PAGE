<p>I have mentioned earlier about three of my works/papers that has stood the test of time according to my own definition, namely, still being referenced/cited 50 years after publication <a href="http://blog.sciencenet.cn/blog-1565-1240521.html" target="_self">http://blog.sciencenet.cn/blog-1565-1240521.html</a> . Research Gate just informed me that a fourth paper of mine just made the list. </p><p> </p><p>It is Differential game and optimal Pursuit-Evasion Strategies, Y.C.Ho, A.E. Bryson, and S,. Baron, IEEE Transaction on Automatic Control, Nov 1965.</p><p> </p><p>This paper actually is the leading in to a collection of papers on differential games and information structure in the early 1970s that are continuously being referenced. They are at the 45+ year mark. With luck I may live to see them add to the list. Finally , my paper that give a simple explanation of the “No Free Lunch Theorem” and my book on “Ordinal Optimization” which are continuously being cited are near their 30+ year mark. I am confident that they will be added to the list. But it is doubtful I’ll live long enough to see it happen.</p><p><br></p>                    <br><br>
