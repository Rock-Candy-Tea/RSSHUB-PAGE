3月7日，第十三届全国政协委员、驻日本大使孔铉佑在中国国际电视台（CGTN）《决策者》栏目发表题为《纪念邦交正常化50周年 ，开创中日关系新前景》的署名文章，回顾总结中日邦交正常化带来的历史启示，并就两国关系未来发展全面阐述中方政策主张。中英文全文如下：
</p>
<p>
今年是中日邦交正常化50周年，这是中日关系发展史上的重要里程碑。50年前，两国老一辈领导人以高超的战略智慧和非凡的政治勇气，作出邦交正常化的重大决断，彻底结束了中日战后对立隔绝，开启了和平友好合作的新篇章，也对地区乃至世界历史进程产生深远影响。
</p>
<p>
中日关系历经半个世纪风雨，两国各领域交流合作实现质的飞跃，双边贸易额创下3714亿美元历史新高，疫情前人员往来达到每年1200万人次，地方友城260余对。两国利益融合如此广泛而紧密，早已成为相互依存的发展共同体。双方要珍惜和维护中日关系来之不易的发展成就，也要从中汲取照亮未来的智慧。
</p>
<p>
历史启示我们，政治体制、社会制度、意识形态差异不应成为国与国交往的障碍。50年前，两国老一辈领导人本着相互尊重、求同存异的精神，超越差异，在冷战环境下实现邦交正常化，树立了不同阵营国家和平共处、友好交往的典范。双方在1972年《中日联合声明》中明确写入，“中日两国尽管社会制度不同，应该而且可以建立和平友好关系。”50年后的今天，双方没有理由做不到这一点。
</p>
<p>
历史启示我们，和平、友好、合作始终是双方必须牢牢把握的正确方向。中日两国在邦交正常化之初，就宣示“建立两国间持久的和平友好关系”。《中日和平友好条约》的签订，以法律形式明确了双方共谋和平友好的履约义务。双方还确立了中日战略互惠关系的定位，达成了“互为合作伙伴、互不构成威胁”等一系列重要共识。无论国际形势如何变化，双方坚持和平、友好、合作的大方向不应有丝毫动摇。
</p>
<p>
历史启示我们，中日四个政治文件及双方共识必须得到不折不扣履行。邦交正常化以来，双方达成四个政治文件，形成一系列重要共识，为处理历史、台湾等重大原则问题及钓鱼岛、涉海等敏感问题立下了规矩。这是两国政府之间做出的郑重承诺，也是确保中日关系行稳致远的根本保障，不容任何挑战。
</p>
<p>
当前中日关系形势依然复杂严峻，新老问题交织凸显，处在不进则退的关键路口。双方要抓住邦交正常化50周年重要契机，维护好、巩固好、发展好两国关系，将构建契合新时代要求的中日关系的政治共识转化为现实，这是时代赋予双方的历史使命。
</p>
<p>
首先要坚持相互尊重，妥处彼此差异。相互尊重是建立互信的前提基础，也是国与国交往的基本礼仪。双方要做到平等相待，互释善意诚意，包容彼此政治体制、社会制度、价值观等差异，尊重对方自主选择的发展道路，恪守互不干涉内政等国际关系基本准则，反对以价值观划线、煽动意识形态对立。
</p>
<p>
二是坚持重信守诺，管控矛盾分歧。中日作为邻国，难免存在一些问题和分歧，关键在于如何管控。中方始终坚决维护自身主权、安全、发展利益，同时愿与日方一道，按照中日四个政治文件原则及有关共识，有效管控矛盾分歧，防止干扰两国关系大局。<strong>日方应在历史、台湾等重大原则问题上信守承诺，切实做到不逾矩、不越线，维护两国关系政治基础。</strong>
</p>
<p>
三是坚持合作共赢，做大共同利益。中国进入新发展阶段，中国的高质量发展、高水平开放将为包括日本在内世界各国带来更多机遇。中日两国要高举合作共赢旗帜，积极推进各领域务实合作，提升合作质量水平，为两国关系注入正能量。我们希望日方在对华合作中展现更加自信、开放、包容姿态，不要被渲染中日竞争对抗、鼓吹对华遏制的消极论调带偏方向。
</p>
<p>
四是坚持友好传统，夯实民意根基。民间友好是中日关系的优良传统和宝贵财富。双方要广泛开展人文交流和民间、地方交往，推动两国民众增进相互理解，深化民心相通。中日关系的未来在年轻一代，双方要重点加强青少年交流，吸引更多年轻人关心中日关系，让中日友好事业薪火相传。
</p>
<p>
五是坚持多边主义，履行国际责任。当前新冠疫情延宕不绝，全球性挑战层出不穷，世界进入新一轮动荡变革期。中日两国都应践行真正的多边主义，从国际社会整体利益出发，保持战略自主，共同为维护地区以及世界的和平稳定、团结合作、发展繁荣发挥重要积极作用。
</p>
<p>
站在邦交正常化50周年的新起点，相信双方一定有足够的勇气和智慧，克服困难，把握机遇，开创新时代中日关系美好前景，将一个更加成熟稳定的中日关系带入下一个50年，这是对邦交正常化50周年最好的纪念。

<strong>China-Japan ties at 50: A new chapter opened for bilateral relations</strong> 
</p>
<p>
This year marks the 50th anniversary of the normalization of diplomatic relations between China and Japan, an important milestone in the history of China-Japan relations. Fifty years ago, with superb strategic wisdom and extraordinary political courage, the leaders of the older generation on both sides made a major decision to normalize diplomatic relations, completely ending the post-war confrontation and isolation between the two countries, and opening a new chapter of peace, friendship and cooperation. It has a profound impact on the course of the history of the region and even the world.
</p>
<p>
After half a century of ups and downs in the China-Japan relations, the exchanges and cooperation between the two countries in various fields have achieved substantive progress, with bilateral trade reaching a record high of $371.4 billion, 12 million pre-pandemic mutual visits every year, and more than 260 pairs of sister cities. The two countries' interests are so broadly and closely integrated that they have long become an interdependent community of development. Both sides should cherish and hold fast to the hard-won development achievements of China-Japan relations and also draw wisdom from them to light up the path toward the future.
</p>
<p>
History has taught us that differences in political systems, social systems, and ideologies should not be an obstacle to state-to-state relations. Fifty years ago, in the spirit of mutual respect and seeking common ground while keeping differences, the leaders of the older generation on both sides went beyond their differences and normalized bilateral diplomatic relations in the context of the Cold War, setting an example of peaceful coexistence and friendly interaction between countries of different camps. It's clearly written in the 1972 Sino-Japanese Joint Statement that "in spite of the differences in their social systems, China and Japan should and can establish peaceful and friendly relations." Today, 50 years later, there is no reason why the two sides cannot do so.
</p>
<p>
History has taught us that peace, friendship and cooperation always represent the right direction that both sides should head in. At the very beginning of the normalization of diplomatic ties, China and Japan declared that they would "establish lasting peaceful and friendly relations between the two countries." The signing of The China-Japan Treaty of Peace and Friendship has clarified in legal form the obligation of both sides to work together for peace and friendship. The two sides also established a strategic and mutually beneficial relationship and reached a series of important consensuses, including "being cooperative partners and not posing a threat to each other." No matter how the international situation changes, the two sides should not waver in following the general direction of peace, friendship and cooperation.
</p>
<p>
History has taught us that the four political documents between China and Japan must be fulfilled without compromise. Since the normalization of diplomatic relations, the two sides have signed four political documents and formed a series of important consensuses, which have laid down rules for dealing with major issues of principle such as history and Taiwan region, as well as sensitive issues such as the Diaoyu Islands and the East China Sea. This is a solemn commitment made between the two governments and a fundamental guarantee to ensure that China-Japan relations will continue to develop steadily and will not be challenged in any way.
</p>
<p>
The current situation facing China-Japan relations remains complex and challenging, featuring both old and new issues, and is at a critical juncture where both countries either forge ahead or drift downstream. The two countries should seize the important opportunities presented by the 50th anniversary of the normalization of diplomatic relations to maintain, consolidate and develop bilateral relations, and translate the political consensus on building China-Japan relations that meet the requirements of the new era into a reality. This is the historical mission entrusted to both sides by the times.
</p>
<p>
First of all, both countries must uphold the principle of mutual respect and properly handle differences. Mutual respect is the premise and foundation for building mutual trust, and it is also the basic etiquette in state-to-state interactions. Both sides should treat each other as equals, show goodwill and sincerity, accommodate differences in each other's political systems, social systems and values, respect each other's independent choice of development path, adhere to basic norms of international relations such as non-interference in each other's internal affairs, and oppose the use of values as a pretext to draw lines and incite ideological confrontation.
</p>
<p>
Second, both countries must keep promises and manage conflicts and differences. As neighbors, China and Japan inevitably have some problems and differences, but the key lies in how to manage them. China has always been determined to safeguard its sovereignty, security and development interests. At the same time, China is willing to work with Japan to effectively manage conflicts and differences in accordance with the principles of the four political documents and relevant consensuses, so as to prevent disruptions to the big picture of bilateral relations. The Japanese side should keep its commitments on major issues of principle, such as history and Taiwan, and refrain from overstepping and crossing the line so as to maintain the political foundation of bilateral relations.
</p>
<p>
Third, both countries must seek mutually beneficial cooperation and expand common interests. As China enters a new stage of development, its high-quality development and high-level opening-up will bring more opportunities for all countries in the world, including Japan. China and Japan should hold high the banner of mutually beneficial cooperation, promote pragmatic cooperation in various fields, improve the quality of cooperation, and inject positive energy into the bilateral relations. We hope that the Japanese side will demonstrate a more confident, open and accommodating stance in its cooperation with China and will not be led astray by negative rhetoric that exaggerates the competition and confrontation between China and Japan and calls for containment of China.
</p>
<p>
Fourth, both countries must stick to the tradition of friendship and establish favorable public opinions toward each other. People-to-people friendship is a fine tradition and valuable asset of China-Japan relations. Both sides should carry out extensive people-to-people and sub-national exchanges to promote mutual understanding and deepen the bonds between the people of the two countries. The future of China-Japan relations lies with the younger generation. Both sides should focus on strengthening youth exchanges and attracting more young people to take an interest in the bilateral relations so that the cause of promoting China-Japan friendship can be passed on from generation to generation.
</p>
<p>
Fifth, both countries must uphold multilateralism and fulfill international responsibilities. At present, as the COVID-19 pandemic rages on and global challenges abound, the world has entered a new round of turbulent changes. Both China and Japan should practice genuine multilateralism, act in the interests of the international community, maintain strategic autonomy, and jointly play an important and positive role in maintaining peace and stability, solidarity and cooperation, and development and prosperity in the region as well as in the world.
</p>
<p>
Standing at the new starting point of the 50th anniversary of the normalization of diplomatic relations, I believe that both sides will have enough courage and wisdom to overcome difficulties, seize opportunities to usher in a new era of better China-Japan relations and bring a more mature and stable China-Japan relationship into the next 50 years, which is the best way of commemorating the 50th anniversary of the normalization of diplomatic relations.
