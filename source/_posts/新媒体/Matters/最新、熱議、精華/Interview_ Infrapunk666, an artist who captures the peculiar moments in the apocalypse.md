From left to right: Portrait-0002: God of another world / Gatekeeper / Portrait-0003: God of another world</span></figcaption></figure><p>This is an article following by another one that shares my personal affection to <a href="https://twitter.com/infrapunk666" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Infrapunk666</a>'s artwork "Death Angel." As mentioned previously, i did a little interview with him, in order to know more about this mysterious artist.</p><hr><blockquote>Q：Starting with the "Death Angel" i collected and extending to all ur artworks, i'm curious about ur thoughts and states when u are creating. Can you tell us a bit?</blockquote><p>A：I drew "Death Angel" many years ago, and there were thousands of similar paintings. The inspiration comes from a movie "<a href="https://youtu.be/5kKbPyU9DAc" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">La Jetée</a>." I like it very much and it enlightens me a lot. I hit on an idea of telling a sci-fi story by paintings.</p><p>I drew and accumulated so many pieces that lots of the feelings or references of them are forgotten as time goes by; but <strong>whenever I hold an exhibition, in which I need to reassemble these pieces into a collage, I will re-reading my own paintings. (And the reassembling process is identical in the world of NFT.)</strong></p><p>My paintings are narrative without a definite story, kind of like capturing a frame from a movie and open up the possibilities of interpretations for the audiences. The following photos are three exhibitions; I reassembled those images every times. <strong>Although there aren't a clear story of my works, I do have a worldview when I'm creating: when apocalypse comes in the far away future, there are peculiar changes happen in this world.</strong></p><figure class="image"><img src="https://assets.matters.news/embed/ec7931b0-3173-4aed-9d8b-9cb689b9e00c.jpeg" data-asset-id="ec7931b0-3173-4aed-9d8b-9cb689b9e00c" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption><span></span></figcaption></figure><figure class="image"><img src="https://assets.matters.news/embed/7ffd8fda-d1c3-4fda-898b-b61f66f81277.jpeg" data-asset-id="7ffd8fda-d1c3-4fda-898b-b61f66f81277" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption><span></span></figcaption></figure><figure class="image"><img src="https://assets.matters.news/embed/c600cc07-1754-49cb-bc06-96f1ae01fefd.jpeg" data-asset-id="c600cc07-1754-49cb-bc06-96f1ae01fefd" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption><span></span></figcaption></figure><figure class="image"><img src="https://assets.matters.news/embed/20314620-09be-43b7-b239-890435c35964.jpeg" data-asset-id="20314620-09be-43b7-b239-890435c35964" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption><span></span></figcaption></figure><hr><blockquote>Q：You usually write "a certain kind of music playing" in the description column. Does music play an important role in ur art? Also, i notice that there are usually an indistinguishable cross-shaped folding lines on ur paintings. What is that?</blockquote><p>A：I describe my paintings by pairing them with a music genre just like dubbing in a background music for them. These genres are also my preferences, and music does play an important role when I create.</p><p>The cross-shaped folding lines are essential. These papers become images after they were painted, but by these folding lines I want to emphasize that they are also objects.</p><hr><blockquote>Q：You had held exhibitions in Italy, also there are stylish costume designing on ur instagram. You seems to have multiple identities in different creative fields. Can u introduce a bit?</blockquote><p>A：I had held several exhibitions in the art museums in Europe. Italy is one of them.</p><p>I'm also a costume designer. At beginning, it just a part-time job for living, but out of surprise, i continued this job for 10 years and have quite some achievements: I served as a creative director for a costume brand for 5 years; my costume design have been exhibited often at home and abroad; I'm also being elevated as a outstanding costume designer by an institution called AAD. Yet everything are completely out of the blue. I was just want a part-time job at beginning (lol.)</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://assets.matters.news/embed/22cdfd90-f23d-47a8-8850-732697e954a0.jpeg" data-asset-id="22cdfd90-f23d-47a8-8850-732697e954a0" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption><span></span></figcaption></figure><figure class="image"><img src="https://assets.matters.news/embed/2be9d723-1004-4e54-aca7-37178b5db642.jpeg" data-asset-id="2be9d723-1004-4e54-aca7-37178b5db642" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption><span></span></figcaption></figure><figure class="image"><img src="https://assets.matters.news/embed/c2c0f8fd-cacf-4bd9-bd2b-fde996fa712b.jpeg" data-asset-id="c2c0f8fd-cacf-4bd9-bd2b-fde996fa712b" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption><span></span></figcaption></figure><p>Later, I start designing costume for performing arts, combining my costume into stage performance. Below are some photos of my works. I collaborated with 3 bands and 1 dancing group, designed for all the costumes of these performances.</p><p>I'm a full-time artist now. I still do costume design, but instead of being in a company, I design costume by my own.</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://assets.matters.news/embed/909ee7c5-86de-4254-99b3-74a977b0577c.jpeg" data-asset-id="909ee7c5-86de-4254-99b3-74a977b0577c" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption><span></span></figcaption></figure><figure class="image"><img src="https://assets.matters.news/embed/4dd5585c-534c-4135-b23f-f93e7a70ed27.jpeg" data-asset-id="4dd5585c-534c-4135-b23f-f93e7a70ed27" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption><span></span></figcaption></figure><figure class="image"><img src="https://assets.matters.news/embed/a359888d-27ff-49ae-999b-3d4f15f67e39.jpeg" data-asset-id="a359888d-27ff-49ae-999b-3d4f15f67e39" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption><span></span></figcaption></figure><hr><blockquote>Q：I sense that most of ur works are dark, cult, mysterious, yet sometimes there is a feeling of redemption. How will you describe your works?</blockquote><p>A：Right, people usually describe my works kind of "dark". But your sense is accurate: there are indeed redemption and hope in this ruined world.</p><hr><p>Here is the end of the interview with <a href="https://twitter.com/infrapunk666" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Infrapunk666</a>. i'm glad that in the final question, he agrees with the "redemption and hope" i sometimes feel in his works, though i could't describe detailedly what that feeling comes from....</p><p>Maybe the answer of it all traces back to the his first apocalypse idea inspired by that 1962 movie "<a href="https://youtu.be/5kKbPyU9DAc" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">La Jetée</a>," which, by searching the brief intro, is a 28 mins sci-fi/romance story of a post-nuclear war experiment in time travel.... i'm not sure? Might watch it later !</p><p>Thanks <a href="https://twitter.com/infrapunk666" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Infrapunk666</a> for accepting my invitation. It's really my honor to know so many details about the creative thoughts and mysterious identity of an artist i admire, and also introducing him to all the frens on WEB!</p><blockquote><strong>Infrapunk666</strong><br class="smart"><a href="https://twitter.com/infrapunk666" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Twitter</a> ． <a href="https://www.instagram.com/chuang.chewei/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Instagram</a> ． <a href="https://www.akaswap.com/tz/tz1hZHvKZZ9m5iBTBkEMaoTg66mMw7M38R6t" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">akaSwap</a> ． <a href="https://objkt.com/profile/infrapunk/created" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Objkt</a><br class="smart"></blockquote>
