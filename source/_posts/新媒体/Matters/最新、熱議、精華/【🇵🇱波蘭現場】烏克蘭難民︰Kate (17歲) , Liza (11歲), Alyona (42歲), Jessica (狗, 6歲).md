It took around 5 hours to across the border from Ukraine side to Poland side. There have a lot of volunteer bring food to us and animals. They also helped us to look after the dogs. </p><p>We took the train from hometown at 3pm but arrived Lviv next day in the afternoon. It supposed to be faster but the train has to go slowly in case of any bombing and emergency situation. Volunteer helping in Lviv as well. The whole journey from home to border took around 24 hours.</p><p>Siren was alerted everyday. We moved from flat to private house so when we heard siren we can hide. When we took the train to Lviv siren was on and very loud. We were very scared. We didn’t know what to do and how to hide ourselves. Another scary thing was Lviv had been second bombed and we are ready to there.</p><p>I want this madness can be over. I wish all countries to make sure that history will not be happened again.</p><p>(Special thanks to Ukrainian Oleg for the translation)</p>
