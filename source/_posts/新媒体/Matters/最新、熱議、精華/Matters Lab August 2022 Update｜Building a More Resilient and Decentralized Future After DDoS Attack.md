The IPs that launched the attack were located worldwide, mainly in the United States, Indonesia, India, Germany, and Singapore. The attack lasted during UTC+8 working hours, peaking at 4 million requests per second.</p><p>For a decentralized content platform supporting beleaguered independent writers, such an attack was more or less expected, although we could not have anticipated the scale of the attack.</p><p>DDoS attacks are used to overload the server with a large number of requests, preventing users from using the service normally. Therefore, all users’ data, content and assets are not affected.
