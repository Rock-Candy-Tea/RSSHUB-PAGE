<blockquote><em>“ Markets face an analogous difficulty that often infects politics. The preferences of the richest people can easily run roughshod over everyone else. What about a hybrid design that combines the best elements of markets and democracy, combining their advantages and canceling out their downsides? ”<br class="smart">- Radical Markets by Eric A.

How will a community collaborate or manage conflicts in a truly decentralized and autonomous environment?</p><p>When Reddit released a collaborative art project in 2017, users quickly filled up a digital whiteboard of 1000*1000 pixels with national flags, LGBT flags, Internet memes, and reenactments of the Mona Lisa. Unfortunately, Reddit Place was taken down after 72 hours before we got to see its full potential — and all the artworks got buried in the information cemetery of the Internet, though you can see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnRCZK3KjUY&t=1s" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a time lapse video</a> of the project here.</p><p>On a centralized server, a decision maker has absolute control over the lifespan of a project.

It uses market forces to regulate public assets, reducing inefficiencies in property and monetary allocation.</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/@simondlr/what-is-harberger-tax-where-does-the-blockchain-fit-in-1329046922c6" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The article</a> also states that there are two main principles of the Tax:</p><ol><li>Citizens put prices on their own property and pay taxes for a percentage of the price.</li><li>The property is always on sale. At any given point in time, anyone else can purchase the property from you at the price that you set.</li></ol><p>These principles prevent a certain group monopolizing the wealth of the society, but create equal opportunities for everyone to achieve wealth.</p><p>Rouviere writes in <a href="https://medium.com/@simondlr/what-is-harberger-tax-where-does-the-blockchain-fit-in-1329046922c6" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">his article</a>:</p><blockquote><em>With Harberger tax, the inability for asset owners to set high, monopolistic, hold-out prices (it’s costly to them personally) OR the ability introduce additional costs to bargaining (seller always sets the price), it more readily allows the market to allocate property to productive owners.</em><br class="smart"></blockquote><p>Some examples of smaller-scale but highly innovative projects of the Harberger Tax are <a href="https://medium.com/@simondlr/this-artwork-is-always-on-sale-92a7d0c67f43" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">This Artwork Is Always On Sale</a>, <a href="https://wildcards.world/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Wild Cards</a>, and <a href="https://www.geoweb.network/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Geo Web Project</a>.</p><h1>The Gameplay Mechanism of The Space</h1><figure class="image"><img src="https://assets.matters.news/embed/349eabe0-8f8b-44b3-b6a5-814315d4beac.png" data-asset-id="349eabe0-8f8b-44b3-b6a5-814315d4beac" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption><span>A co-creation on The Space. Source: Neverlandseeker</span></figcaption></figure><p>In <a href="https://bit.ly/3tWe7dQ" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Space</a>, every pixel is a tradable NFT. Pixel owners can edit the colors of their pixels to create any artwork they like on The Space’s digital wall through blockchain transactions. <a href="https://bit.ly/3MOTDw4" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">See it live in action here</a>.</p><p>Pixels are tokenized as ERC721 tokens and traded under <strong>Harberger Tax: the owner of each plot must mark a price for his plot and make it available for purchase</strong>.</p><p>Drawing from the Harberger Tax, pixel owners on <a href="https://bit.ly/3tWe7dQ" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Space</a> can set any price they want for their pixels. They must also pay a tax, set at a certain percentage, of their land price to the smart contract, of <strong>which a part will be returned to all plot owners in the form of a Universal Basic Income (UBI)</strong>. Not every person will get the same income, however, as the UBI is distributed towards pixels and owners of larger amount of pixels can share higher dividends.</p><p>The Harberger Tax encourages each pixel to remain on sale at all times. <em>We want to challenge existing ideas of ownership and explore a new kind of ownership that transcends socialist or capitalist markets.</em></p><p>So, in brief, the rules of <a href="https://bit.ly/3tWe7dQ" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Space</a> are:</p><ul><li>Pixel owners can set any price for their pixels and pay taxes based on their price.</li><li>If the owner doesn’t want to sell the pixel, he or she can hike up the price to prevent purchase. But this means the owner also has to pay a higher tax to keep the pixel.</li><li>A percentage of the taxes received is recorded on smart contract and distributed to each pixel owner on <a href="https://bit.ly/3tWe7dQ" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Space</a> in the form of a Universal Basic Income (UBI).</li><li>Whether pixel owners decide to sell or keep their pixels, the community benefits from it. If they keep their pixel, the community enjoys a higher UBI. If they sell their pixel, the community gets to own pieces of artwork that they like.</li></ul><p>In setting these rules, we wanted to establish the most effective allocation of limited public resources and maximize the liquidity of the “pixel market”.</p><p><a href="https://bit.ly/3tWe7dQ" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Space</a> is a public resource, but we are privatizing that for buyers in the market. On the other hand, although there’s privatization and trading, The Space still essentially belongs to the public.</p><p>What is interesting is that Web3 and cryptocurrency brings to the table a new form of ownership that goes beyond capitalism and socialism that cannot be categorized. <strong>The closest description is a radical market: a genuinely open, free, and competitive market that can lead to great equality, prosperity, and cooperation.</strong></p><h1>Anticipated Challenges</h1><p>Even though <a href="https://bit.ly/3tWe7dQ" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Space</a> is set up to be a mutually beneficial game, we anticipate that there will be three types of The Space participants when we release it to the public:</p><ul><li><strong>Creators:</strong> deliver messages, contribute to social issues, create artwork, and are willing to pay taxes for it</li><li><strong>Speculators</strong>: purchase pixel areas where prices are predicted to rise, then sell them at higher prices</li><li><strong>Hitchhikers: </strong>buy the cheapest pixels as their tickets to receive UBI, and carefully evaluate the balance between the amounts of their UBI and Harberger taxes they need to pay.</li></ul><p>Moreover, creators can either collaborate on creating a grand project that contributes to the society or maliciously destroy others’ projects through transactions. It’s intriguing to see how participants will interact with each other on <a href="https://bit.ly/3tWe7dQ" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Space</a>.</p><h1>Testing Out The Space</h1><figure class="image"><img src="https://assets.matters.news/embed/6e9c5eab-f666-4731-ac1a-5a5bcab04827.png" data-asset-id="6e9c5eab-f666-4731-ac1a-5a5bcab04827" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption><span>Participants trading and coloring pixels on The Space.

We wanted to launch it on a smaller scale with time limits to observe, adjust, and troubleshoot. With repeated reiterations, our goal is to improve the user experience, the social dynamics, and refine the economic structure.</p><p>Since December, we’ve launched five game-test events for a total of 300 creators who colored at least 50,000 tokens as pixels.</p><p>In our latest test launch, 50 Taiwanese artists co-created on <a href="https://bit.ly/3tWe7dQ" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Space</a> and the final artwork was <a href="https://bit.ly/36lBKV2" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">minted as NFT on akaSwap</a>. 99% of the proceeds will go towards <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/IMC_Worldwide" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">@IMC_Worldwide</a>, <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/DirectRelief" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">@DirectRelief</a>, and <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/save_children" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">@save_children</a>.</p><p>Although we haven’t implemented any kind of tax or reward mechanism in our prototype, we already saw, on this small scale experiment, how players collaborate with each other to tackle problems and create new economies.</p><p>Stay tuned for our next article, where we unravel how participants interacted, solved conflicts, and co-created on <a href="https://bit.ly/3tWe7dQ" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Space</a>.</p><h1>The Space: a radical Web3 social experiment</h1><p>At the Matters team, we are passionate about operating a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) to build a community of self-governed users, which we have successfully done with <a href="https://bit.ly/3Id6Vig" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Matters.news</a>.</p><p>We’ve taken it one step further with <a href="https://bit.ly/3tWe7dQ" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Space</a>, by setting up a collaborative social experiment that will always be accessible, forever, on blockchain. Anyone can participate in The Space, as long as they hold SPACE tokens.</p><p>Radical markets will probably never become a reality. In practice, it causes far too much upheaval to how companies, markets, and nations work. <a href="https://bit.ly/3tWe7dQ" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Space</a> presents a “what if” controlled social experiment, a technology that can be built and improved upon. This is an incremental and moderate idea we can have fun with.</p><p>In one participant’s words’:</p><blockquote><em>The Space is a social experiment, an experiment with a positive result. Even communities without leaders can collectively create something beautiful, which is what I love about this game. The cohesive force is fascinating.</em></blockquote><p>At the end of the day, <a href="https://bit.ly/3tWe7dQ" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Space</a> is a social experiment to deduce how players collaborate, create, and at times, confront each other in a world where they make their own rules without a central government and share the profits together.</p><p>We’re excited to see how <a href="https://bit.ly/3tWe7dQ" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Space</a> goes. What about you?</p><p>The final version of <a href="https://bit.ly/3tWe7dQ" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Space</a> is debuting on testnet in April, 2022 and will be officially launched in May 2022.</p><p><em>Interested in NFTs?
