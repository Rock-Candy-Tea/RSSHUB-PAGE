<p><strong>A</strong>:"I feel sad"</p><p><strong>B:</strong> " Why? what happens?</p><p><strong>A:</strong> He misunderstand me and don't want to listen anything from me.</p><p><strong>B:</strong> who misunderstand you?</p><p><strong>A:</strong>My friend <strong>"C" </strong>misunderstand me. I am really a idiot to make wrong group and he get angry because I make wrong group.</p><p><strong>B:</strong> You are really a idiot, so you make a wrong group with<strong> "C' </strong>and someone else?</p><p><strong>A: </strong>NO, I make wrong for <strong>"C" </strong>friend "<strong>D"</strong> and my besty <strong>"E"</strong>.</p><p><strong>B:</strong> You make wrong group for <strong>"D"</strong> and <strong>"E"</strong>. Why <strong>"C"</strong> need to angry?</p><p><strong>A: </strong>Because E is my besty, I always share everything with "<strong>E",</strong> But <strong>"E"</strong> is crazy sometimes.</p><p>He send the msg to <strong>"D"</strong> and ask who is <strong>"C"</strong>.</p><p><strong>B:</strong> wait, wait wait. here is one problem. How <strong>"E"</strong> know about <strong>"D"</strong>?</p><p>You say you make wrong group for<strong> D </strong>and <strong>E</strong>. It's mean they don't know about each other righ?</p><p><strong>A: </strong>Yes, They don't know each other. But, <strong>E</strong> come to ask me who is that? I thought <strong>E</strong> is my friend and <strong>D</strong> also become my friend, so I don't want to hide anything. You know me well also. I don't like to hide anything to friends. I tell<strong> E</strong> that <strong>D</strong> is friend of <strong>C</strong>.</p><p><strong>D</strong> also come to ask me who is <strong>E</strong>. I say to <strong>D</strong>,<strong> E </strong>is my good friend.</p><p><strong>B:</strong> It's weird then. You make wrong group to <strong>E</strong> and <strong>D</strong>. Then it should be <strong>D</strong> or <strong>E</strong> angry on you, But why <strong>C</strong> angry on you because of wrong group? <strong>C</strong> should be angry like <strong>E</strong> come to ask who is <strong>C</strong> like that. And you are a idiot. <strong>D</strong> and <strong>E</strong> don't know each other. You know need to tell each other who are they.</p><p><strong>A:</strong> Yeah. I really don't know why<strong> E </strong>do like this. Do you know when <strong>E </strong>tell me He ask<strong> D </strong>about <strong>C </strong>that time, i thought <strong>E</strong> is kidding with me. until <strong>C</strong> come to ask me about <strong>E</strong> that time, i know <strong>E</strong> really do that.</p><p><strong>B:</strong> I think it's not a big problem. Big problem is why <strong>C</strong> angry on you make wrong group and block you. You never add<strong> C </strong>in wrong group and <strong>E </strong>only know about <strong>D</strong>. He still doesn't know about who is <strong>C</strong>. How <strong>C </strong>become a notice and publish?</p><p><strong>A:</strong> Yeah, why he angry because I make a wrong group? But he also angry about I always talk with <strong>D</strong> and discuss about <strong>C</strong>.</p><p><strong>B:</strong> It's also weird. C must know that you always talk with D and have a friendship with D.</p><p>last time D kidding with you and say to you <strong>C</strong> meet a someone in midnight and <strong>C</strong> come to say to you don't believe<strong> D</strong> and say to you <strong>D</strong> is kidding with you. But <strong>C</strong> is not angry with you that time.</p><p>It's mean he must know you talk with <strong>D</strong> always even talk about him sometime. How can he angry with you about this? Even say it's publish ans notice?</p><p>It's mean<strong> D</strong> is a common friend between you and <strong>C.</strong> I feel like that. C just want to make a reason and kick you out.</p><p><strong>A: </strong>What should i do now?</p><p><strong>B:</strong> Just leave him. I think he is not good.</p><p><strong>A:</strong> Nope. It's just your thinking. I want to know by himself.</p><p><strong>B:</strong> Alright. As your wish.</p><p> It just a story. If anyone think it's happens in their life, it is a coincidence</p>
