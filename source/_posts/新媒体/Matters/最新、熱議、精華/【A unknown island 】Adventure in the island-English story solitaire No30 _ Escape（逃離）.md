Hurry up!"</p><p>Viswa first stuffed his fingers into ears.</p><p>Suddenly, he recalled all the memories that he forgot.</p><p>The memory that he worked for Matty, which was the system that maintained all the story world order. Then, he remembered that somebody roughly transmigrated into this story and brought zombie virus from another Armageddon story.</p><p>In the original story, Yttam was the hero who won the jewelry game in the island and got the opportunity to make a wish from angel, and Nick was the most important rival of him. However, due to the virus, Yttam now became the miserable character who tried to save the world and Nick shifted to be the villain who worked for the castle.</p><p>Because people became zombies and the storyline changed dramatically, the story world was on the verge of crashing. Finally, Matty decided to put them in the story and made them as the characters in the book.</p><p>And that's why Viswa was here.</p><hr><ul><li>🧭<strong>No.29| No Time to Waste (無暇費時）</strong><a class="mention" href="https://matters.news/@baoshin" target="_blank" data-display-name="鑫大叔" data-user-name="baoshin" data-id="VXNlcjo1OTc0OA">﻿<span>@鑫大叔</span>﻿</a></li></ul><p>The silence was broken by the sound of three gunshots. Viswa looked around and found Yttam, Santosh and Harsha were all dead. Vasim pointed gun at Viswa said: “Surprised, aren’t you?”</p><p>“Please allow me to introduce myself again. I’m Mike, and also the transmigrator who brought over the virus.” Vasim smiled and took off the plastic mask.</p><p>“What you want from me?” Viswa asked with anger.</p><p>“Relax, transmigrators like us in this world just like playing a game, death just send us back to our world. All I want just an audience who isn’t afraid of the virus to watch the show with me.”</p><p>“Fine, tell me why you turn Nick into zombie? Aren’t he worked for you? Why you hide him in the lab?” Viswa forced himself to calm down and asked.</p><p>“Good questions, that’s what a good audience shall ask.” Mike replied happily. “I’m here to test the power of the virus. Stupid Nick took you to test, but you are a transmigrator! I don’t need an idiot, so he became a zombie.”</p><p>Took a glance on the Nick’s dead body, Mike said: “Remember the first game said who caught the first zombie will be the winner? The virus will change whenever it passed to another person. Only medicine made based on the first zombie is useful to ensure the effectiveness of the virus.”</p><p>“Sorry to interrupt the man’s talk, but we are running out of time.” Something flight out from nowhere and passed through Mike, his neck was spurting blood from the wound.</p><p>It was the <strong>iPhone</strong>! It emitted a dazzling light, <strong>Sally</strong> walked out and passed the phone to Visma.</p><p>“No time to waste, do what you shall do! I’ll settle Mike and show him my gratitude for what he did while I lost my memory.”</p><p><s> “No time to waste, do what you shall do! I’ll settle Mike.”</s></p><p><s>“A fair lady like you shan't interrupt the conversation in such manner.” Mike wipe away the blood on his neck and there’s no wound at all.</s></p><p><s>“Vampire? I’ll show you my thankfulness for what you did while I lost my memory” Sally said dismissively.</s></p><p><s>“You are much more charming when you lost your memory.” Mike said in exaggerated way.</s></p><p><s>“This world and Viswa need a superwoman.
