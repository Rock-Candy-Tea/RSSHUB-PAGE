<p>Bombarding has already spread to my hometown. There were about 10 explosions in general. The world seems to slowly get used to this war which is horrible. It doesn’t get any better. In Mariupol there is a humanitarian disaster, people are dying without water and food. They have no possibility to bury their relatives who passed away, so sometimes they (including children) just have to sit in a bombshell next to them. Stories from people who managed to get away from there tear the heart apart. </p><p>轟炸已經蔓延到我的家鄉，一般約有十次爆炸。這個世界似乎慢慢習慣了這場可怕的戰爭，這卻對戰爭沒有任何幫助。在馬里烏波爾發生了一場關乎人道主義的災難，有人在缺水和食物的情況下死亡，而他們的家人沒有機會埋葬過世的親人，有時他們（包括孩子）只可以坐在死人旁邊的重型炸彈上。那些設法逃離戰地的故事令人傷心痛苦之極。</p><p><br></p><p>My colleague’s grandparents live in that city, she (the colleague) is going insane trying to evacuate them, so far unsuccessfully. My friend’s friend and his pregnant wife in Kharkiv have lost their flat with all their money and clothes. A Russian soldier in Kyiv has raped a Ukrainian woman, had killed her husband before, and her little son was crying in the next room. </p><p>我同事的祖父母住在那個城市，同事因為到目前為止還沒成功疏散祖父母到其他地方，個人狀況也變得非常焦急。我有朋友的朋友和在哈爾科夫的懷孕妻子失去了所有的錢和衣服。在基輔，有一名俄羅斯士兵強奸一名烏克蘭婦女，之前還殺了她的丈夫，而他們的小兒子在鄰房哭泣。</p><p>In Sumy where my other colleague used to live 11 girls were raped by Russian soldiers and only 5 of them survived, their life is ruined. </p><p>Not a single sane person can understand how it’s possible that the Russian government, officers, soldiers and those ordinary people who support war can do this or let this happen or be so cruel without a single reason. </p><p>我另一位同事住蘇梅多年，那裡有十一位女生被俄羅斯士兵強姦，當中只有五人倖存下來，這些人的生活被毀了。</p><p>沒有一個理智的人能理解，俄羅斯政府、軍官、士兵和那些支持戰爭的普通民眾，怎麼可能無緣無故地做到這一點，讓這種事情發生，或者如此殘忍。</p><p><br></p><p>One amazing Ukrainian woman named Tata gathers, buys and packs medicine and ammo to send to our soldiers and to people in hot spots. She posted a grateful message from her friend, a woman who helped evacuate people from Mariupol. So this woman was carrying a little girl in her hands to save her when something exploded nearby. A piece (shard/ chip, IDK how you call it) hit this woman’s back. Thank God, she was wearing a bulletproof vest that Tata gave her, so she got away with just a bruise. It was one of the few times Tata let herself cry. </p><p>Tata，一位令人詫異的烏克蘭女生，她幫忙收集、購買和包裝好藥品和彈藥，而發送給烏克蘭的士兵和在戰區裡的人。她透過朋友發布感謝信息，而那個朋友幫助其他人從馬里烏波爾撤離。這位朋友在發生爆炸的附近救了一個小女孩，期間被一塊碎片擊中背部。慶幸她穿著Tata給她的防彈背心，所以只留下了瘀傷，沒有生命危險。</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>
