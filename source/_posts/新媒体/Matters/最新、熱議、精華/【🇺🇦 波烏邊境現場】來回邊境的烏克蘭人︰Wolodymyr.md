I am too old to fight but I really hope I can fight for defending my country.</p><p>I am working in Poland and usually going back to Ukraine to see family during weekend. I live close to the border. It’s quite unknown how long will it (war) take but people continue living in during the war.</p><p>The war is terrible. I am in a medical group and receiving messages all the time. Sometimes just feel helpless. I am a driver. I have helped and brought people from Ukraine to Poland for three times.</p><p>A huge queue was in the Ukrainian border.I guess it was thousand people there. It was madness especially you can see crying children everywhere. During that time two women died in the queue while waiting to cross the border because of health condition. </p><p>My wife is from East Russia. My wife was calling her sister after three days of the war, who is in Russia. My wife said “ Do you know that your army is bombing Ukraine for three days?” Her sister said “ What you are talking about?” Even after three days they still have no idea what Russian was doing here. </p><p>(Special thanks to Ukrainian Oleg for the translation)</p>
