<p><strong>HONG KONG/TAIPEI/LOS ANGELES, Jan. 14 2022 </strong>— <a href="https://bit.ly/3ABesWa" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Matters Lab</a>, the Web3 social media platform with 80,000 content creators, has announced a USD 2 million Pre-A fundraising round in January 2022. The injection of funds for Matters Lab will lay the groundwork for other innovative, pioneering web3 projects in the pipeline. Investors span a range of major web3 players: <a href="http://www.longling.com/?lang=en" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Longling Capital</a>, <a href="https://protocol.ai/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Protocol Labs</a>, <a href="https://mask.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mask Network</a>, <a href="https://crust.network/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Crust network</a>, <a href="https://infinitylabsnft.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Infinity Labs, </a><a href="https://assembly.partners/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Assembly Partners</a>, and <a href="https://www.incuba.capital/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Incuba Alpha</a>, .</p><p>Matters Lab is best known for its hugely popular, open-source decentralized Web3 publishing platform, <a href="https://bit.ly/3FtxD52" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Matters.news</a>.
