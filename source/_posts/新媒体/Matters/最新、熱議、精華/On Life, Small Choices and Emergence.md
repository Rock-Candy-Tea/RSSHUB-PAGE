<p>Brown: “Exactly. And it’s trying to hold onto stuff and not let it die that actually puts us in precarious positions, even for our species. This is actually one of our biggest issues right now is we’re so scared of death. And so we think about how do we make people live forever, and how do we look young forever, and do all this stuff instead of being like, Oh, no. How do I get good at dying? How do I get to where I’ll be at peace when my time comes, because there’s other generations that need to survive off of the resources of this place?It’s in the design.”</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://assets.matters.news/embed/df01105d-087b-4627-8a76-f9ce665745db.jpeg" data-asset-id="df01105d-087b-4627-8a76-f9ce665745db" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption><span>A morning snapshot on Ba Tong Guan Historic Trail (Dongpu).</span></figcaption></figure><p>The article is quoted from a inspirational podcast <a href="https://onbeing.org/programs/adrienne-maree-brown-we-are-in-a-time-of-new-suns/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">On Being</a>, the words flow beautifully like buzzing sunlight reflecting the greens in forests, I wanted to remind myself about the fractals of life force: </p><pre class="ql-syntax" spellcheck="false">Everything dies, but it makes for a very rich world. All the richness, all that fecundity, all that beautiful miracle of life, it happens because we live in cycles, not perpetuity.
</pre><p><strong>And as you say, composts something else, right — other seeds. Other seeds then have their moment, have their time.</strong></p><pre class="ql-syntax" spellcheck="false">Emergence doesn’t wait for us to be ready for change, and we’re really in an accelerated moment of that right now.
</pre><p><strong>But as you know, change is really hard for human beings. It’s hard for us at a creaturely level, and also, we all individually handle it in different ways at different times. I feel like this wisdom is so powerfully embedded in the way you think and the way you’re working. And one of those for me is the way you use the word “fractal.” </strong></p><pre class="ql-syntax" spellcheck="false">So I was doing electoral organizing in 2004 — 2003, 2004 — we’re gearing up. It’s post-9/11. It’s like, we’re going to war with Iraq and Afghanistan. And we’re like, we’ve got to get Bush out of office. So we’re doing all this organizing, and it clicked for me, in a way that I couldn’t — You see it, and you can’t un-see it. 
oh, we are trying to just change the top layer of this very layered cake, this very layered process, this system of governance. We think that if we just win the presidency, that then we’ll be able to change the world.
And it clicked for me that actually, it’s a fractal system. And it’s layer on top of layer on top of layer. And if none of us are practicing democracy anywhere, it’s not going to just suddenly work at the top layer. [laughs] And I got it.

I realized — so something about smallness, I was able to gain respect for because every single large system or structure or network or political protocol, all of it is made up of small things: of humans either having or not having necessary conversations, and humans being willing to stand up for what is right and stand up against what is wrong. 

It’s all these small activities that we need to get great at if we want to actually have anything that would be a real democracy.
</pre><p><strong>This language of fractal comes from mathematics, right? originally.</strong></p><pre class="ql-syntax" spellcheck="false">Yeah, and the first thing that I was exposed to was actually fractals — the Fibonacci — this sequence is basically how something repeats at scale, no matter how small it gets and no matter how large it is. And it’s these particular patterns in the universe.

But sometimes I’ll use the language of fractals. Sometimes I’ll just point to actual examples. Look at a head of broccoli. Look at a fern. Look at the delta around New Orleans, and then look at how these veins and artery systems move through your system and your heart and your lungs. Look at the spiral shapes on your fingertips, and then look at the shape of galaxies.

And in that way, we can begin to see there are no isolated patterns. The universe has some favorites, and they repeat and they repeat, at every scale. Your body is a whole water system. There’s all these different formations that are all how to move water. And we’re one of them. And I find it very comforting to find myself in one of those patterns.
</pre><p>Their conversation explains my love for plants, nature and wisdom in everything the cosmos would manifest to us. Keep changing. Keep growing. Stand upright like fern, Spread love like flying spores.</p>
