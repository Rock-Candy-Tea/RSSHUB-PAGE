<p>Here’s to the crazy ones. The cynics. The whistleblowers. The snarkiest of all. The <em>real</em> writers. The ones who see things differently. They’re not fond of UGC. And they have no respect for crowd sourcing. You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them, or write lengthy counter-argument on your own fucking blog. About the only thing you can’t do is leave comments on their blogs. Because they change the default setting of WordPress. They push the quality of online content forward. While some may see them as the crazy ones, we see self-respect content creators. Because the people who are crazy enough to disable comment on their blogs, are the ones who do.</p>
