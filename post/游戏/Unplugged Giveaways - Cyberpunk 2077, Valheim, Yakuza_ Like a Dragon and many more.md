<p>Why we're doing this?</p>
<p>I (Chains) always see games on sale on steam and have come to the realization that I already own many game, so I thought I'd give back to the community. I created this group not expecting much to happen, but over time has turned out to be a great interactive group thanks to our members! As a group, we are also trying to raise awareness for charity groups and organisations you may not have heard of through these giveaways. I hope you'll have a fun time being a part of our community </p>
