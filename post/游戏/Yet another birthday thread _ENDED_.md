<div>   
<p>So, I've got a year older today, happens to the best of us. There's nothing to do about that. What I can do, however, is gift something nice to beautiful people of SG, so here are some <a href="https://www.steamgifts.com/giveaway/eiB6g/the-beast-inside">GAs</a>. Quality might be all over the place, but there are some real gems inside as well (for example, I'd strongly recommend Detective Di and OPUS to everyone interested in adventure games). All GAs are level 3.</p>
<p>While we are that, I've decided to finally get a VR headset (Oculus Quest 2, of course). I would be grateful for game recommendations (just please, no anime, racing or anything physically exhausting).</p>
<p>Edit: wow, guys! I've just realized that I'll be physically unable to answer this number of congratulations, so thank you all from the bottom of my heart!</p>
