<p>Hope to see you all again this month :)</p>
<p>Due to timezones/people not being online 24/7 I am still accepting any edits/applications for February for the next couple of days (till the February thread is closed).</p>
<hr>
<p>The theme for this month is</p>
<h2>Chart Toppers - The Box Edition</h2>
<p>(Thank you to samwise84 for the suggestion!)</p>
<p><strong>really long games 25h+ HLTB (any HLTB time)</strong><br>
<strong>games with 50P</strong><br>
<strong>games where someone is named Rodrick or Wayne</strong> *<br>
<strong>games released in January, Februrary or March</strong><br>
<strong>racing games, games where you can drive fast cars</strong> *<br>
<strong>sports games/ games where you can play basketball</strong> *<br>
<strong>games where you can rob places/ play as a thief</strong> *<br>
<strong>games with politics / where you can play a politician</strong>*<br>
<strong>games with police</strong>*<br>
<strong>games with hip hop soundtrack</strong>*<br>
<strong>tags: action, combat racing, competitive, crime, destruction, diplomacy, driving, fast-paced, great soundtrack, heist, loot, looter shooter, lore-rich, political, political sim, politics, racing, sports, vehicular combat</strong></p>
<p>* Please provide some kind of explanation/proof (screenshots or link to some proof) in the notes or it will be rejected.</p>
<h3>No win that fits the theme or played them all?</h3>
<p>Please use the "Note" section when submitting the game to inform me of this situation. </p>
<hr>
<p>You can submit this months games you are going to play here:</p>
<h1><strong><a href="https://pagywosg.xyz/events/22" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://pagywosg.xyz/events/22</a></strong></h1>
<h2><a href="https://pagywosg.xyz/help/faq" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">FAQ</a></h2>
<hr>
<h2>Who can participate</h2>
<p>Anyone who does <strong>not</strong> have any unactivated wins, multiple wins or a VAC ban. You can participate even if you don't have any SteamGifts wins, see the "Have already completed all your wins?" below as it applies to this scenario too.</p>
<hr>
<hr>
<h2>Extra Rules:</h2>
<ol>
<li>No comment on this thread? If there is something wrong with the game you submitted it gets deleted. With this many participants we can't chase after everyone.</li>
<li>No comment on this thread = not invited to join/re-join the group. </li>
<li>Any idle time (e.g. idleing for cards, answering the phone/door, looking up solutions, etc..while the game is still running) needs to be added to the time before the month. We want to have times that are as "clean" as possible for the leaderboard. Any time that is higher than 2x HLTB time will be considered as abnormally high and will raise questions. </li>
<li>If we ask for proof that a game fits a certain category, please link the appropriate proof (e.g. screenshots, explanation, videos, etc.) in the notes section of the game entry on the event page. Same goes for the ending screenshots for games without achievements. </li>
<li><strong>DLC</strong>: <em>I've won/bought a story DLC, can I (re-)play the game?</em> If the DLC has achievements go ahead. If it has an ending achievement reaching that is enough. If there is no ending achievement you will need to complete  all DLC achievements for it to count. If you have more than one story DLC then you can play each one as separate entry for different months as long as the main game fits the theme. Please only add the main game to the event page and note in the notes section that you are going for DLC achievements.</li>
<li><em>I've won a game bundle. Do I have to play all games for it to count?</em> If the bundle gives you several games with different steam ID's feel free to play them one by one.<br>
If it gives you one bundle of games with one steam ID then it depends. Do they each have achievements of their own (including an ending achievement)? Then go ahead and play them separately. Though make a note in the notes section, so we know what to look for.  Non achievement games or games that play continuously (e.g. all entries play through without an ending between them) are not allowed atm since we do not have a good way to track them separately.</li>
<li>The event officially opens at 00:00 UTC, any playtime/achivements before that won't be counted.</li>
