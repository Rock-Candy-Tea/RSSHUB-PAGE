<p>Here we go, I'll start.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1270761" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Don't Be Afraid Of The Dark (2010)</a></strong> - This movie is a joke. At first it's interesting, then it's boring and then it's just funny/pathetic. And they put it in a "horror" genre. Words are not sufficient. Nosferatu is turning in his grave. 3/10</p>
