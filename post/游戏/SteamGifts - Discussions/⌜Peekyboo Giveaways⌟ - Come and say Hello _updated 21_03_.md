<p><strong>Welcome to Peekyboo</strong>  - (I'm currently updating this ignore the mess)</p>
<p>I'm quite simple when it comes to the "sales pitch" so this will be small and sweet<br>
Group was created in 2016 as just a clan tag but over the years we've turned into a giveaway community.<br>
I run 99% of the giveaways on my own and it can be a tough job at times but that's part of the fun of it for me.<br>
(make a bit longer)</p>
