<p>Rejoice the time for another karaoke contest has arrived!</p>
<p>A few things to note </p>
<ol>
<li>all singers will be anonymous to prevent favoritism when it comes time to judge the contest </li>
<li>after the contest, I will reveal the identity of all contestants I have the permission to reveal.</li>
<li>There is no rule 3<br>
3.1 there really is no rule 3</li>
<li>Recording will be done on their own computers.  I suggest audacity (<a href="http://audacityteam.org/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">http://audacityteam.org/</a>) for this.  the songs will be uploaded to a folder on google drive.  Contact me on steam or on the <a href="https://www.steamgifts.com/discussion/QsbYP/officially-unofficial-steam-gifts-discord-monthly-giveaways-new-ga-added-mar-19">unofficial SG discord server</a> and I will send you a  link to a folder you can upload to.</li>
<li>To verify authorship I ask that the singer to upload a vocal only track.  if they want they may also upload a mixed track.</li>
<li>Singers may submit as many songs as they like.</li>
<li>you must stand at least 6 feet away from all other singers at all times.</li>
<li>These are your songs, I will take down any song at any time by the user request , I will also comply with any copyright take down requests if I revive them.</li>
<li>All participants will be given a list of invite only giveaways that they can enter.  If anyone wants to contribute a giveaway contact me and I'll add the giveaway to the list.</li>
<li>have fun, this rule is NOT optional</li>
</ol>
<p>About naming conventions When upload a song I'd like you to name it "song-artist-VOCALS"  for the vocal only submission and "song - artist-MIX"  For example if you sang "Mad World" by Gary Jules, you would upload  "Mad World - Gary Jules - VOCALS"  I would also appreciate if you upload a text file with your steam name, the favorite song you've covered, and if you want you name relieved after the contest ends.  </p>
