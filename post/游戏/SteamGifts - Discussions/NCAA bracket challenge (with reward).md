<p>It's March Madness time, so I'm doing a fun challenge. The SG community gets to play along with me and see who has the best bracket. You don't need to be a basketball fan or even care about sports (in fact being a sports fan won't really help you much). The top finisher will get a game or DLC under $20 USD of their choice.</p>

<p>Deadline is Friday 3/19</p>
<p>I will update the standings here as well so people can track how well they are doing.</p>
<p>If you are from the EU and wish to enter, I can enter a random bracket for your name under my account 10/10 slots taken (up to 10 can request this).</p>
<p>15/15 slots taken<br>
Edit: upped limit to 15.</p>
<p>Best of luck and happy gaming!!</p>
