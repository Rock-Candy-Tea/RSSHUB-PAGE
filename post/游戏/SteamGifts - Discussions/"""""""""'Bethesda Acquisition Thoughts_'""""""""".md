<div>   
<p>Microsoft announced a while back that they acquired ZeniMax which includes Bethesda the developer of legendary Franchises/Games like The Elder Scrolls, Fallout, DOOM, Dishonored, Wolfenstein, etc. from their previous parent company. </p>
<p>What are your thoughts on this? Does it hype you up? Does it concern you? Both? </p>
<p>My thoughts:<br>
I think its overall a good thing.</p>
<p>Pros: I hope this allows Bethesda access to the mountains of resources Microsoft holds being a $1.737 trillion market cap company. I was worried and hesitant to support the Mojang Acquisition fearing they would exploit Minecraft in an "EA" type of way. But I've been pleasantly surprised by Minecraft progression since then. Mojang held a decent amount of autonomy in the aspect of content included while being guided by the business savvy Microsoft is known for. Keep in mind I personally don't like Sony and many of their actions and business models. I see this as securing Sony's inability to make it their exclusive making it very hard for even PC players to access where as Xbox is much more pro-multiplatform.</p>
<p>Cons: Questions have been raised about the console wars and whether Bethesda titles will be exclusives on Xbox related services. Could they stifle the creativity Bethesda is known for? Publisher pressure from a shareholder driven company. We all know how cancerous developer crunch is and how uncaring publishers are when they are a publicly traded entity on the stock market. Investors only care about how quickly they can get their investment returned with profits. Please note that when a game is released without being finished it is almost never the developer's fault as they have little to no control on release dates and publishers don't care about quality they care about numbers. This type of behavior is encouraged by pre-orders and season pass purchases as they have just secured their profit without necessarily providing quality in return. Rarely do they get punished unless an extreme, drastic difference between promises and reality exist and even then the damages are mitigated the bigger the publisher is.</p>
