</li>
<li>
<p>Can I enter to win a gift for my friend / family / brother / cousin / dog / pet gerbil?<br>
Gifts have to be activated in your account. This is a steamgifts rule.<br>
If your friends want to join, have them apply here.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You don't have to enter all group giveaways - Remember you only have up to 8 gifts so choose wisely!<br>
Its actually much preferred if you only enter giveaways for games you actually want.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can non gifters create giveaways for the group?<br>
'Normal' members can also create group giveaways for each other. Actually this is encouraged. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can I join the group as both gifter as normal member?<br>
You can join the group as both, or become a gifter once you have won the gift quota.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I have more than 8 wins but not all wins are from the group, do I still have to leave?<br>
Yes, the win count refers to your steamgifts account, it is not group specific.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I have to leave the group but still have ongoing group giveaways I am part of, can I still win those?<br>
No, if you have to leave please exit all ongoing group giveaways you are a part of.<br>
We get very angry when we have to perform dozens of re-rolls on people that left / were kicked from group days ago and still "win" group giveaways.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I am a gifter but have less than 8 wins on steamgifts, can I enter group giveaways for normal members?<br>
yes, once you reach 8 or more wins you become a full 'gifter'. Until then you can enter all 'normal' group giveaways.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I am a gifter and want to enter 'open to gifters' giveaways. Why do I need this silly +7 gift difference rule?<br>
This is not a ratio group, however, we've had cases of people not understanding that 'gifter' members should be...gifting.<br>
So if we see a "Gifter" that won 20 gifts in group and only gave away 3 bad rats we will be angry.<br>

<p>Edit 25th August 2019: I kicked inactive members that have not used Steamgifts in 2019. It is possible that I clicked the wrong line by mistake and kicked someone who is active here. If I have done so, please post in this thread and you will be re-invited.</p>
<p>Edit 23rd April 2020: As there are quite a lot users who do not care for the requirements of the gorup and just try to join on Steam, please do not post here afterwards, I probably will not invite you. There might be exception for active SG users who can give a good explanation for their mistake.</p>
