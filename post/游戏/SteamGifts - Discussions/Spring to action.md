<div>   
<p>Here it is. March 21st - the 80th day of this year, and according to astronomy we have officially a Spring since yesterday. Some of you might have started a spring cleaning, some of you will start it soon, and some don't care. But there's a saying I've heard, and it goes something like this: "A house in order is a mind in order". </p>
<p>Unfortunately I can't help you with setting your house in order, but maybe I can help with your mind?<br>
With New Year, many people make resolutions and with nobody to watch over us, we usually start forgetting them very fast, or something more important comes up.  And when next December comes suddenly, we start feeling bad over doing nothing we wanted to have done. Why not deal with this problem now?</p>
<p>So... tell me about your New Year's resolutions, how things are going with them, and if you simply forgot about them, conciously gave up on them, or were forced to abandon them. And somewhat similarly to BLAEO (backlog fighting initiative), you might get inspired to try again. One more attempt at almost lost cause? And when the event ends in 7 days, maybe you'll have changed something? Or maybe you're on top of your game, and want to brag how much control over your life you have? Go on and share the news as well!</p>
<p>Oh, and <a href="https://www.steamgifts.com/giveaway/xeqIo/verdict-guilty-yujoe-pyeong-gyeol">here's some giveaways</a><br>
<span class="spoiler">You can get busy living, or you can get busy dying. It's always a choice.</span></p>
<p>Edit: moved my own resolutions to a comment, to not scare you all with a wall of text :P</p>
