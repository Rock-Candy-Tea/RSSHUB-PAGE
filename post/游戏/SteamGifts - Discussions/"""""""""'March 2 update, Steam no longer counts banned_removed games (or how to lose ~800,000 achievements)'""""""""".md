<div>   
<p>Went from 100k to 31k achievements on my steam profile, did they remove the count from them "rubbish" games?<br>
Also about 20-25 perfect games are removed and average games played count also lowered.</p>

<p>Quoted from Reddit: JonP_valve Valve Employee x hours ago<br>
"I think what you're seeing here is a visibility fix for games that were already banned. These were erroneously not removed from some profile-visible features when banned. That bug was fixed with a server update yesterday.<br>
Note this only applies to games that were banned - games that are retired at the request of a publisher or developer are unaffected."</p>
<p>If your profile seems unchanged make sure to have atleast 1 new achievement after the update date.<br>
You can't also show those removed achievements in your showcase anymore.</p>
