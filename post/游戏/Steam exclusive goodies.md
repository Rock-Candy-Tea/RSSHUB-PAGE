Get Cyberpunk 2077 on Steam to receive a short story written by our Story Lead, Tomasz Marchewka.

"2AM — She Calls" will show you the hostile streets of Night City as seen by Frank, an ex-NCPD officer working the night shift as a Combat Cab driver.

In addition, you'll also get a set of exclusive goodies including avatars, posters, and a wallpaper!
