<p>But first, mark your calendars to join RegisKillbin, Community Manager Chris Sierra, and Game Designer Liv Breeden on March 22 at 10:00 a.m. PT as they reveal the final <em>Forged in the Barrens</em> cards on stream at <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/PlayHearthstone">Twitch.tv/PlayHearthstone</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/Hearthstone">Youtube.com/Hearthstone</a>!</p>

<h4><strong>Decklist Submission Contest</strong></h4>

<p>On March 22, 16 Hearthstone Creators will take to their social channels to source desklists from YOU to play during Theorycrafting Livestreams. <strong>Each creator will select one winner, with that winner earning a free Mega Bundle code!</strong></p>

<p>If you’d like to submit a deck of your own just <a href="https://playhearthstone.com/deckbuilder"><strong>visit our website and build a Standard deck</strong></a> using at least 10 <em>Forged in the Barrens</em> cards. You can have 10 unique cards or duplicates (such as x2 of 5 cards). Then, reply to your favorite creator’s deck contest post on March 22 with your deck code and a brief description of how it works. The winning decks will be played by the creator that selected it during Theorycrafting Livestreams on March 23!</p>

<h4><strong>Theorycrafting Livestreams</strong></h4>

<h4><strong>Mega Bundle Giveaways and Gifted Subs</strong></h4>

In addition to opening your packs early, Pre-release will also feature Fireside Brawls that will let you play with new cards!</p>

<ul>
<li>In the <em>Forged in the Barrens</em> No Cards Barred! Brawl, you’ll be able to construct decks using the cards that you open during the Pre-Release event. There are no restrictions on class or duplicates, so go crazy!</li>
<li>We’ve also got A Recipe for Tenacity, a pre-constructed Brawl that will include new deck recipes from the upcoming set for you to play with. You won’t need to have pre-purchased packs to play this Brawl.</li>

<p>Private pre-release Fireside Gatherings will take place the weekend before <em>Forged in the Barrens</em> goes live, March 26 at 10:00 a.m. PT – March 29 at 10:00 a.m. PT.</p>

<p align="center"><a href="https://www.firesidegatherings.com/">Head over to FiresideGatherings.com to register your one-person event!</a></p>

<hr>
<p><strong><em>In light of the ongoing global health risks associated with in-person gatherings, we’ve canceled official Fireside Gatherings for the near future and disabled the ability to create public events.</em></strong></p>

<p><strong><em>We do, however, want individuals at home to have an opportunity to partake in the upcoming Pre-Release weekend, so we’ll be keeping private event functionality intact. Players can register their own one-person event to enjoy opening Forged in the Barrens card packs from March 26-29.</em></strong></p>

<p><strong><em>Thank you all, innkeepers and patrons, for understanding.</em></strong></p>

<p><strong><em>Private Fireside Gatherings will:</em></strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong><em>Be eligible to receive Nemsy Necrofizzle if they fulfill all hosting prerequisites. This means having an established Tavern - </em></strong><a href="https://firesidegatherings.com/learn-more"><strong><em>Learn more about how to establish your tavern here.</em></strong></a></li>
<li><strong><em>Be eligible for the Fireside Gatherings card back.</em></strong></li>
<li><strong><em>Allow event listing creation the same day it is meant to be hosted.</em></strong></li>
<li><strong><em>Have the same Fireside Brawls as public Fireside Gatherings.</em></strong></li>
<li><strong><em>Be visible on the website only to the innkeeper hosting it. The Fireside Gathering itself will be visible in the game client, and participants will be able to search and find it in the client as well.</em></strong></li>
</ul>

<p><strong><em>Private Fireside Gatherings will NOT:</em></strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong><em>Be visible on Tavern or upcoming event pages.</em></strong></li>
<li><strong><em>Show up if anyone tries to search for it on the upcoming events page.</em></strong></li>
<li><strong><em>Count towards any Tavern or Innkeeper progression. They will not count towards establishing your Tavern. You will still need to host public events in the future with at least 3 check-ins in order to establish your Tavern.</em></strong></li>
</ul>
