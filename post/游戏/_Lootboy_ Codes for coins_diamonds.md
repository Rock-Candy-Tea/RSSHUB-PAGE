<h1>News & Stuff:</h1>
<h2>- Due to the <a href="https://www.steamgifts.com/discussion/fLrRZ/new-regional-steam-wallet-code-rules">changes to Steam Wallet Codes</a>, you might not be able to redeem Steam Wallet codes from Lootboy if your Steam account uses a different currency than EUR. Lootboy support may be able to help you in such a case.</h2>

<p>Thank you, Lilly!  (◕‿◕)♡</p>
<hr>
<h3>Additional hints:</h3>
<ul>
<li>You can redeem the codes here: <a href="https://www.lootboy.de/redeemCode" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://www.lootboy.de/redeemCode</a> (If you have trouble redeeming the codes, try disabling adblock or try again later) (Link to main site: <a href="https://www.lootboy.de/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://www.lootboy.de/</a>)</li>
<li>Diamonds can be used to purchase the premium lootpacks in the diamond section</li>
<li><strong>The names of the lootpacks only describe the exclusive loot for that pack! In most cases you just get something from the general pool for all packs, wich contains Origin/Uplay/GOG/Steam/whatever games. So even if you get the "Supreme Steam" pack, you may not get a steam game!</strong></li>
<li>You now get a special golden lootpack after every tenth premium lootpack you open.</li>
<li>You can scrap cards that you don't want for 100 coins each (after you revealed the code it's only 10 coins)</li>
<li>You get 350 coins for reading the comics (new one each friday)</li>
<li>It doesn't seem to be possible to get a steam game from the 2000 coins lootpack, but they can contain diamonds (very low amount and very rare).</li>
<li>If you get a duplicate key or have some other problem, try contacting their support :) - <a href="https://www.lootboy.de/support" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Here</a> or write a mail to: support@lootboy.de/support@lootboy.com</li>
<li>The iOS/Amazon version of the app doesn't have all the stuff, there are no offers on the bonus wall and the redeem-code button is missing.</li>
<li>You can purchase packs with amazon coins (more info <a href="https://www.steamgifts.com/discussion/rSWOI/lootboy-codes-for-coinsdiamonds/search?page=66#c1NfBQU">here</a>)</li>
<li>You can find a list of some games that people got <a href="https://barter.vg/bundle/3902/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">here</a> or check the charts linked above</li>
<li><strong>Warning:</strong> If you get the game "Bedlam", "Measurement Problem" or "Jasem" there's a good chance that it's a duplicate key. Lootboy-support may give you a new pack if that turns out to be the case.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Group:</h3>
<p>It seems Lootboy has gotten a lot better when it comes to duplicated keys, but if you still have doubts about a key, you can use the group below for those giveaways :)<br>
<del>Unfortunately it happens far too often that Lootboy is handing out duplicate keys, so a lot of people feel uncomfortable with creating public giveaways with the games from Lootboy. So I just created a little group with some rules to make it less risky for the generous givers.<br>
I hope this helps :)</del><br>
