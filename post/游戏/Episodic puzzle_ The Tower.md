<p>This is an episodic story puzzle. A new chapter is added every week until the story is done. The story begins and ends in Baldur's Gate.</p>
<p>In addition to the obvious puzzle and GA, there are often additional GAs hidden along the way. Happy hunting!</p>
<p>Feel free to discuss which games you found in the GAs.</p>
