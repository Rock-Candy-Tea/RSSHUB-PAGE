<p>Last year we collaborated with our World of Warcraft communities across the globe to create a new mount to gift all players with <em>Shadowlands</em> activated on their account. Now the winning choice—the Wandering Ancient—is available to all players with Shadowlands activated on their account and for those who purchase <em>Shadowlands</em> at a later date. Eligible players can find the Wandering Ancient in their Mount Collection tab (Shift + P).</p>

<p><em>Not all ancients are interested in war or lore, some just want to travel the world! This arboreal nomad has traveled to many places and with each passing season embraces change, both in scenery and in the foliage atop its branches.</em></p>
