<p>You can make a difference in the global response to COVID-19 by taking part in the World of Warcraft®  Charity Pet program. Your donations will go directly to support the medical humanitarian aid organization Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) and can help toward gifting two battle pets to the World of Warcraft community.</p>

<hr class="image-divider">
<h4><strong>How it Works</strong></h4>

<p>We’ve made a change to how our Charity Pet program works and during this campaign, you’ll be able to donate* any amount you wish <a href="http://events.doctorswithoutborders.org/?fuseaction=donorDrive.event&eventId=599&language=en" target="_blank">directly to</a> Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF). Between today and April 26, 2021 (or upon reaching our stretch goal), all donations will contribute to the MSF COVID-19 Crisis Fund to support the organization’s global response to the pandemic and its consequences (donations will be collected by MSF-USA.)</p>

<p>We’ll be tracking your donations and once a goal of $500,000 USD has been reached, we’ll make Bananas, the Monkey available for everyone† playing modern World of Warcraft** as a thank you, whether you were able to donate personally or not.</p>

<p>In addition, if we reach a stretch goal of $1 Million USD, everyone will receive a second pet, Daisy the sloth. She’s an all-new pet that you can carry with you everywhere you go right on your back!</p>

<p>Born on an island off the coast of Stranglethorn Vale, little Bananas is a son of King Mukla, a fierce leader of Skymane Gorillas. Luckily, Bananas fell far from the tree and his gentle disposition makes him an ideal travel companion who will brighten your days on Azeroth and beyond. </p>

<p>Meet Daisy, one of the most ponderous sloths in all of Azeroth. In between battles, take it easy and appreciate the world at her pace. When adventure calls again, simply /beckon, and she’ll happily hitch a ride hanging from your shoulders. </p>

<h5><strong>About the COVID-19 Crisis Fund:</strong></h5>

<p>In the face of the unprecedented global crisis of the coronavirus pandemic, MSF has created the COVID-19 Crisis Fund.</p>

<p>The fund aims to raise urgently needed money for the MSF emergency response to the COVID-19 pandemic and its consequences. The fund also enables supporters to designate their donations as contributions restricted specifically towards this global effort. Money raised through the fund will support MSF’s COVID-19 response activities worldwide, including program costs related to treating people with COVID-19, and addressing the impacts of the pandemic on MSF regular programs.</p>

<p>The objectives of the MSF global response to COVID-19 are to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Stop, slow down, or delay transmission of the virus</li>
<li>Provide care for patients (particularly the seriously ill)</li>
<li>Minimize the impact on health systems and communities</li>
<li>Spread information on infection prevention measures and risks</li>
<li>Enhance water, hygiene, and sanitation supplies and activities</li>
<li>Provide palliative care for the most seriously ill patients in contexts with limited resources</li>
</ul>

<p>A majority of funds will be used or go towards:</p>

<ul>
<li>The acquisition of supplies such as oxygen for patients and personal protective equipment for staff</li>
<li>The creation of isolation zones in MSF and non-MSF health structures such as clinics and hospitals</li>
<li>Staff training on handling and treatment of people with COVID-19</li>
<li>Implementing infection prevention and control measures – including, triage and patient referral, among other activities</li>
</ul>

<p>Your generosity to the MSF COVID-19 Crisis Fund will enable urgently needed medical care and support in more than 70 countries to counter the new coronavirus disease.</p>
