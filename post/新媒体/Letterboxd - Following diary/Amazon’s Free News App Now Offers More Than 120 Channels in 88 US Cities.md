            Amazon has expanded news coverage with support from the regional divisions of ABC, CBSN, TEGNA, Cox, The E.W. Scripps Company, and Altice USA. Aside from local news, which gets its own tab in the app, customers can also access content from ABC News Live, CBS News, Reuters, Cheddar, Entertainment Weekly, Black News Channel, and more.

            Upon opening the app for the first time, you'll be greeted with a prompt asking you to cherry-pick the news that matters most to you. This permits the software to personalize your experience and focus on stories and local news relevant to you.

            Based on your preferences and topics of interest, the AI-powered software will automatically create a custom playlist on your behalf. You can also start the app up by saying "Alexa, play the news," "Alexa, play local news" or similar with the included Fire TV voice remote or from across the room with the Fire TV Cube or the Echo speaker.

            If you'd like to follow local news in even more cities than the Amazon app currently supports, you should check out the free NewsOn app, available on the Fire TV along with the Roku.
