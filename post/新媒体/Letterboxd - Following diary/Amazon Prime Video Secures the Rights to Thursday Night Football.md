            Amazon's Prime Video will be the exclusive home of the NFL's Thursday Night Football games. A massive $1 billion/year agreement marks not only the league's first all-digital partnership but also the biggest sports deal with any streaming service so far.

            The deals kick off in 2023 and last through 2033, according to the official announcement on the <a href="https://press.aboutamazon.com/news-releases/news-release-details/amazon-prime-video-makes-history-first-streaming-service-secure" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon website</a>. The company will exclusively broadcast 15 Thursday Night Football games and one pre-season game per year on its Prime Video streaming service in the US.

                        <p>
            With the new ten-year exclusive agreement signed, Prime Video will be the only place to watch the NFL's Thursday Night Football games nationally, starting in 2023. Previously, these games were also available on terrestrial and cable TV.

                        <p>
            Local over-the-air broadcast networks can still air the games but only in select cities. Thankfully, this will permit people who aren't subscribed to Amazon Prime or Prime Video to tune in via their cable operator (or other regular pay-TV services) or with a digital antenna.

                        <p>
            Also, Prime Video will host new pre-game, half-time, and post-game shows. Like before, games will include Amazon's interactive features, such as X-Ray and Next Gen Stats.

            As part of the new deal, Prime Video also secured rights to a weekly slate of original NFL programming and expanded rights to in-game highlights for all NFL matchups. Prime Video and the NFL will continue to collaborate on exclusive NFL content and enhanced fan viewing experiences around Thursday Night Football, with more information to come ahead of the first game in 2023.

            As you can see for yourself, these new ten-year deals and arrangements have also helped expand the online availability of many of the NFL's games.

            Amazon's been simulcasting TNF games aired on the Fox network since 2017, but now it'll be streaming a full slate of games. The exclusive deal will require Amazon to invest heavily in NFL production like camera operators, commentators, motion graphics, etc.

            Amazon, along with other technology companies, has never negotiated such an exciting content deal for this long even though it's been streaming NFL games for four years now. That said, the company's exclusive agreement is going to matter to curd-cotters, even more so now that streaming has spiked in popularity during the coronavirus pandemic.
