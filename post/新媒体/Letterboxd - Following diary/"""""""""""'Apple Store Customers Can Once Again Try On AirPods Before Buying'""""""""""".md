            In a sign that Apple Stores are starting to return to business as usual, coming out of the coronavirus pandemic, customers are once again able to try on AirPods before making a purchase at many outlets.

It has now pulled back on these restrictions, meaning that both walk-in customers, and those who have made appointments, can try in-store AirPods to ensure they fit correctly before they decide whether or not to buy.

            This comes several months after Apple relaxed this same policy for Apple Store customers in Asia. China, in particular, has been several months ahead of much of the rest of the world when it comes to Apple's anti-coronavirus retail policies. Apple made the call to close retail stores in China before it did anywhere else, but then also opened the stores again prior to doing so elsewhere.

            Apple shuttered its Apple Stores in the United States, and other non-China countries, in March last year. Some Apple Stores began reopening in May 2020. However, it was only in early March 2021 that all 270 retail stores were reopened in the United States at the same time.

            Apple is currently rumored to be working on new regular AirPods. While some reports suggested that these would debut at <a href="https://www.makeuseof.com/apple-event-march-23-rumor/">Apple's next special event</a>, likely to be held in April, reliable Apple analyst Ming-Chi recently said that they will not debut until the second half of the year. The third-gen regular AirPods are expected to borrow the same design as the AirPods Pro, although may lack some of the high-end features.
