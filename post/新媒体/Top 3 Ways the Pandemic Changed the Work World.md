<p><span data-contrast="none">There was a common refrain in July that said that the world of work changed more in the preceding 30 weeks then it had in the last 30 years.  I think there is a lot of truth to that assertion, but I must note that many of the voices arguing that the work world has irrevocably changed were the same voices advocating for those exact </span><span data-contrast="none">changes</span><span data-contrast="none"> pre-pandemic.</span><span data-contrast="none"> </span><span data-ccp-props="{"201341983":0,"335559739":160,"335559740":240}"> </span><span data-contrast="none"> </span><span data-ccp-props="{"201341983":0,"335559739":160,"335559740":240}"> </span></p>
