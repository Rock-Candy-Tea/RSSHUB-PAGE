<div><p><i>“Whenever Mr. Vengeance’s not on screen, all the other characters should be asking, ‘Where’s Mr. Vengeance?’”</i></p><p><br>just a bad time that only gets worse and worse. such incredibly satisfying plotting. framing and the shot composition in general made me go antonio-banderas-at-the-computer. very excited to go through park chan-wook’s filmography if it’s all like this and <i>The Handmaiden</i>! extremely my shit. why is this movie so wet</p></div>
