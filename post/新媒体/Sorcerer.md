<div><p>Perfect movie if you want to reorient yourself on your couch and go "aaAAAaa jesus christ" every few minutes. Provokes such visceral reactions I'm aching to rewatch it with different people. (Several months apart, so my bones have time to settle between viewings.) Makes <i>Uncut Gems</i> look like a vacation slideshow.</p><p>While I'm here– William Friedkin's a psychopath, right? Drives me nuts that all the stories about his insane filmmaking antics genuinely result in masterpieces. Like yes, he shot a car chase in New York without a permit and fired guns on set, but out of that we got <i>The French Connection</i> and <i>The Exorcist</i>. These movies should've sucked to teach us all a lesson. Real irresponsible failing on the universe's part. One (1) human belongs in a cage and it's William Friedkin.</p></div>
