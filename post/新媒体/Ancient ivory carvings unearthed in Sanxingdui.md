            <div class="text  en"><p>Chinese archaeologists have discovered six new sacrificial pits at the Sanxingdui Ruins in southwest China's Sichuan Province, holding over 500 items dating back about 3,000 years.</p><p>Among them, the No. 3 sacrificial pit held more than 100 pieces of ivory and bronze ware. </p><p>Most of the cultural relics have burn marks. Archaeologists believe that during the ancient Shu civilization, sacrificial offerings such as bronze and ivory were burned before burial.</p><p>The excavation site is covered by a large steel greenhouse, with several glass enclosures covering the newly discovered sacrificial pits. This archaeological "excavation chamber" is filled with all kinds of equipment to control the temperature and humidity, as well as reduce the microorganisms and bacteria introduced by the staff. </p><p>The giant tusks, more than a meter long, were carefully hoisted out of the sacrificial pit after being moistened and fixed in plaster by archaeologists.</p></div>

            <div class="text  en"><p>When the No. 1 and No. 2 sacrificial pits were excavated in 1986, much of the ivory could not be properly preserved due to inadequate technology at the time. However, the newly unearthed ivory fragments and carvings will be carefully preserved, numbered and recorded.</p><p>They will be sent to the Sanxingdui Cultural Relics Restoration Center for further research.</p><p>(Top image designer: Li Jingjie.)</p></div>
