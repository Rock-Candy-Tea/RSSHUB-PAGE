I am a professional photographer and I am french. I am (a little) bit famous for my work: Be Myself, people will love you.</p><h3>When and why did you start journaling?</h3><p>I started journaling in 2012. My first entry was written after a circus show. I included a nice photo – according to me – and just wrote : this is my first journal entry. I will try to daily put a photo with a text.</p><h3>What is your journaling routine?</h3><p>I am not the kind of guy who’s daily writing his journal. I don’t have the time. Or a story to tell. Sometimes, when a beautiful thing happens, I appreciate to write it down. To remember. But… When I’m abroad, and it happens a lot, Day one is the tool I need. Several times a day, I like to write entries. Where I was, people I met, places I have discovered… I can add a nice photo with my iPhone. Or, and it’s even better, I can later add a beautiful photo with an export tool from Lightroom directly to Day One. This way, I will remember. Very convenient when I feel blue or when I miss sun.</p><p><img alt="image-3.png" src="https://media.graphcms.com/hWkGc7ERUiqHFH0PUQKH" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></p><h3>Do you focus on long-form writing, or in capturing small memories of life?</h3><p>If I have something to develop, I’d rather write it on my <a href="https://mistervautier.wordpress.com/">blog</a> (<a href="https://mistervautier.wordpress.com/">mistervautier.worpress.com</a>). On the other hand, most of my travel blogs articles are inspired from my Day One articles.</p><p><img alt="image-2.png" src="https://media.graphcms.com/3apJ9QB2kku3F7EwIBAu" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></p><h3>Do you have a favorite spot where you like to journal?</h3><p>No. Everywhere. With my iPhone.</p><h3>What was your first entry in Day One?</h3><p><img alt="image-1.png" src="https://media.graphcms.com/2eBLctK0RwKYtPbrWBjG" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></p><h3>How many entries do you have in your journal?</h3><p>2207<!-- -->.</p><h3>What is your favorite or most-used feature in Day One?</h3><p>I really do appreciate to see the daily notifications about what happened one year ago, two years and so on… Today, it happens to (re) discover souvenirs from five years ago !</p><h3>Do you write mostly on the iPhone, iPad, or the Mac?</h3><p>Mostly my iPhone. And sometimes with my iMac to export beautiful pictures from Lightroom to Day One.</p><h3>Do you follow any journal organization rules?</h3><p>No. When I want to write.</p><h3>Have you ever relied on Day One for something unexpected, or used it to recall details about a specific event or date?</h3><p>No, not really. Day one has a feature I particularly appreciate. With my Apple Watch, I can instantaneously create an entry. This way, it will automatically record the place I am in. Later, I will write and insert pictures. Et voilà.</p><hr><p>Thanks Gilles.
