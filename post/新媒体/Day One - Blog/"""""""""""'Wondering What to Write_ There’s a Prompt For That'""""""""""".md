There’s a Prompt For That." width="2232" height="1248" src="https://media.graphcms.com/oq22HXMKTX5BQ8vgjo9z" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><p>When we launched Templates last year, we did so hoping an in-app framework for repeated journal responses would help facilitate daily journaling. Many journalers like to log the same type of response each day, and Templates make this easy to do. Our Templates library includes Day Summary, 5 Minute PM, Meals, Ideas and more. Users can also create their own custom Templates.</p><p>The response to Templates has been overwhelmingly positive, and we believe it has helped many in their journaling quest. However, as wonderful as repetitive journaling is, sometimes our brains are looking for a more unexpected spark, which is why we’re excited to announce the launch of Daily Prompts. Our team has curated a large (and growing) database of prompts, which will live inside the Day One app and rotate out for a new one every 24 hours. You'll find prompts like:</p><ul><li>Who is someone you’ve always admired?</li><li>What do you think of Daylight Savings Time?</li><li>What was your favorite movie as a kid?</li><li>When did you first fall in love?</li><li>How would you describe yourself to a stranger in one paragraph?</li></ul><p>On the iPhone, Daily Prompts are accessed through the + menu in the bottom navigation bar. On the iPad and Mac, the Daily Prompt will show up in the right pane. Simply tap or click the prompt and a new entry will be created automatically, ready for your response. It’s so convenient, it almost makes journaling too easy. Almost. Prompts may become something you do daily or occasionally as a writing exercise. They are designed to stimulate creativity, promote deeper thinking, and be a fun, personal outlet. There are no wrong answers and there's no need to Google a response. Simply type what comes to mind and then come back again tomorrow to find a completely unique prompt. Note: If you aren’t seeing Prompts in your Day One app, make sure you’ve updated to Version 4.9 on iOS and Mac. Prompts are currently unavailable on Android. We’re excited to make it even easier to interact with Prompts, and have a widget, reminders, and additional refinements coming in the following weeks. <a href="https://help.dayoneapp.com/en/articles/3750565-daily-writing-prompts">Prompts Cheat Sheet</a></p>
