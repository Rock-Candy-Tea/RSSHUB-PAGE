But if it has Day One installed, it’s actually a journal. And a camera. And it’s with you every day, ready to capture your life. Which is why we’ve decided to launch the #PhotoADay challenge. It’s simple and you definitely don’t need to be a photographer to participate. Starting September 1st, <a href="https://help.dayoneapp.com/en/articles/436325-adding-photos-and-videos-to-entries-in-day-one-for-ios">snap a photo and save it to your journal</a> with the hashtag #PhotoADay. If you’re a Premium member, you can even <a href="https://help.dayoneapp.com/en/articles/839872-creating-journals-in-day-one-for-ios">create a new journal</a> just for this collection of images. You can add a caption or a text entry to your photo, or you leave it as just the photo. You’ll then repeat the process the next day, and the day after, through the entire month of September.</p><div><video width="400" height="550" controls="false" autoplay="autoplay">
