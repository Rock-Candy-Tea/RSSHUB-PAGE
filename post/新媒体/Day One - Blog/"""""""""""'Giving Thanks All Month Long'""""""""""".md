<p>Turkey and pie, football and family. If you live in the United States, you know the day we’re talking about is Thanksgiving. This joyous autumn holiday is celebrated each year on the 4th Thursday of November. It’s a day where friends and family gather to feast, enjoy one another’s company, and express gratitude. It’s that last part we’re going to focus on—not just in this blog post—but throughout the entire month of November.</p><p>Many studies have been conducted on the benefits of gratitude, and the results are astounding. Expressing gratitude can improve physical and psychological health, aid sleep and self esteem, enhance empathy, and create stronger, happier relationships. This is not to imply that being thankful is a panacea for personal problems, but it can certainly be beneficial.</p><p>With all there is to be thankful for, one day a year simply isn’t enough. Which is why we’re dedicating the entire month of November to thanksgiving and gratitude. Each Monday, we’ll be turning to Instagram to introduce a new gratitude focus for the week.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><img alt="NovemberSchedule.png" src="https://media.graphcms.com/l6IsIvVASvyYGGjOB8WI" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></p><p>We’ll be sharing template ideas, journal challenges, user spotlights, and more. But what we really want is for this month to be an open conversation. We’d love to hear about all the things, places, and people you’re grateful for. We’re interested to hear how you use Day One to express gratitude and thanksgiving in your life. And we hope that by the end of the month, you will have experienced the personal benefits of an increased attitude of gratitude in your life.
