<p>When we released Version 1.0 of Day One 8 1/2 years ago, we never could have imagined what Day One would become. It was just a simple journaling app in a big, crowded app store. We didn't know if success would come, but we knew we had to try. Over the years, we've added new capabilities so you, our users, could capture more of what matters most in your lives.</p><p>This month on Instagram, we focused on gratitude of different kinds, with this week's focus on the people we are thankful for. On this Thanksgiving day (here in the United States), we feel especially grateful for our users. Some of you have been with us since day one, others may have just joined today. To each of you, we say thank you. Thank you for supporting Day One. Thank you for telling your friends and family about us, writing positive reviews on the app store, and for being Premium subscribers. Because of you, we are able to continue creating something we believe has the power to make the world a better place, one entry at a time. As we come to the close of another year, we wish you and yours all the best and look forward to a great year to come.</p><p> </p>
