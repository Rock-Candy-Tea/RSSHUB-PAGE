<img alt="Version 3.4: Drawing, Fonts, and Photo Layout" width="1994" height="1340" src="https://media.graphcms.com/GB7rdSyRTqsfZdm1HQOS" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><p>iOS version 3.4 is <a href="https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/day-one-2-journal-+-notes/id1044867788?mt=8&at=10lnHI&ct=dayoneappcom">now available</a> and adds several new features and a long list of updates. See the comprehensive <a href="http://help.dayoneapp.com/release-notes/ios-release-notes">Release Notes page</a> for all the details.</p><p><strong>Drawing</strong> has been the top feature request for a long time. We've been able to create a simple first version of drawing inside Day One to make it easy and fun to write words and draw using Apple Pencil on iPad, or your finger on iPhone. See <a href="http://help.dayoneapp.com/tips-and-tutorials/drawing-in-day-one-on-ios">here</a>.</p><p>Three beautiful <strong>new fonts</strong> from Hoefler & Co. are now available in the editor. These fonts are specifically built for the screen using a term called ScreenSmart. Sentinel, Ideal Sans, and Whitney. (These will also be added to Mac next week.)</p><p><img alt="dayone-3.4-New-Fonts.jpg" src="https://media.graphcms.com/2kLaMBwRPuNJbZr6TOaC" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></p><p><strong>Dynamic Photo Layout</strong>. We've written an algorithm that auto arranges photos, in order, to create the best visual layout without cropping any parts of the image. The same photo group viewed on a narrow display will lay out differently on a wide display (iPhone vs Mac or iPad).</p><p><img alt="dayone-3.4-Photo-Layout.jpg" src="https://media.graphcms.com/tLIBvWNARkuYj1pa5rBF" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></p><p><strong>Apple Watch audio recording</strong>. We've redesigned the Watch user interface to be 3 pages, the center page is the main control with the same 2 buttons, New Entry, and Record Audio. Swipe left to see the recent activity feed locations and the check in button. Swipe right to see the new audio record controls. Now you can set an audio recording from 15 minutes up to 6 hours!</p><p><img alt="dayone-3.4-Watch-Audio.jpg" src="https://media.graphcms.com/GjNDGq64RvCLRHpjSqji" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></p><p>The recording screen will minimize to a discreet view to reduce brightness and distraction, tap once to bring up the status and stop button. Force press on the recording screen to see an option to Stop and Start New.</p><p>Let us know what you think of the new features. We hope these contribute to your goals of creating a comprehensive journal history of your life.</p>
