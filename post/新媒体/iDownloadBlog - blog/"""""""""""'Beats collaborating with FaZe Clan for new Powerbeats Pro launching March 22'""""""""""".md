<p><a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/tag/beats/">Beats by Dre</a>, owned by Apple, is no stranger to teaming up with the professional esports organization FaZe Clan. And now the two are back with a new collaboration.<span id="more-858319"></span></p>
<p>Unveiled today <a href="https://twitter.com/beatsbydre/status/1372979648276086786">on Twitter</a>, Beats has confirmed it will be working with FaZe Clan again for a new variant of the Powerbeats Pro. FaZe’s primary color way is red and black, and you’ll see that inspiration on these new Powerbeats Pro. You can see the new headphones pictured below.</p>

<p>The tweet that Beats sent out today confirms the new headphones will be limited edition, and you’ll only be able to buy them through the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/the-ntwrk/id1425910407?_branch_match_id=901553473130981444">NTWRK</a> app. This app allows customers to shop for limited edition apparel, including sneakers and accessories, so this fits the bill.</p>
