<p>Both iOS & iPadOS 13 and 14 support native <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/tag/picture-in-picture">picture-in-picture</a> mode — a feature that activates a floating video player so that you can watch a video while continuing to use other apps on your device — but this interface doesn’t look as sleek on iOS & iPadOS 13 devices as it does on iOS & iPadOS 14 devices.</p>
<p>If you’re jailbroken on iOS or iPadOS 13 and you’re interested in having the iOS or iPadOS 14 picture-in-picture interface on your handset without updating to the latest firmware, then we think you’re going to take an interest in a newly released and free <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/tag/jailbreak-apps-tweaks">jailbreak tweak</a> dubbed <strong>14PiP</strong> by iOS developer <em>Galactic Dev</em>.</p>

<p><span id="more-858193"></span></p>
<p>The before and after screenshot examples below, which were initially <a href="https://reddit.com/r/jailbreak/comments/m89tu7/free_release_14pip_bring_the_ios_14_style_pip/">shared</a> on /r/jailbreak by the developer, will help you discern the major differences between the iOS & iPadOS 13 and 14 picture-in-picture interfaces, just in case you weren’t already keenly aware of them:</p>

<p>Not only is the iOS & iPadOS 14 interface sleeker than that of the iOS & iPadOS 14 interface, but it makes better use of the available real estate with properly sized buttons.</p>
<p>The modern aesthetic of the iOS & iPadOS 14 picture-in-picture interface design is a wonderful way to complement any pwned iOS or iPadOS 13 device, and if you agree, then you can <a href="https://galacticdev.me/">download the tweak for free from Galactic Dev’s personal repository</a> via your favorite package manager.</p>

<p>Obviously the tweak is only intended for <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/jailbreak">jailbroken</a> iOS & iPadOS 13 devices, as iOS & iPadOS 14 devices already have this aesthetic at their fingertips.</p>
<p>14PiP is <a href="https://github.com/Galactic-Dev/14PiP">open source on Galactic Dev’s GitHub page</a>, and if you’re not already using the developer’s repository, then you can add it to your package manager of choice by using the following URL:</p>
<pre><span style="color: #800000;">https://galacticdev.me/</span></pre>
