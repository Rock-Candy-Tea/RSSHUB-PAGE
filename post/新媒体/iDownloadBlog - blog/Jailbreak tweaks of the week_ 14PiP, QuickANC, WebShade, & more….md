The jailbreak community has been particularly charged over the course of the past several weeks following <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/tag/unc0ver">unc0ver’s</a> newfangled support for iOS & iPadOS 14.0-14.3 and the <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/2021/03/10/coolstar-teases-sileo-ios-14/">teasers</a> comprising of CoolStar’s upcoming iOS & iPadOS 14.0-14.3 jailbreak.</p>
<p>Of course, the excitement surrounding these jailbreaks and the hype has also resulted in an explosion of recent iOS 14-centric <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/tag/jailbreak-apps-tweaks">jailbreak tweaks</a>. This roundup will go over all the latest ones released between Monday, March 15th and Sunday, March 21st.</p>

<p><span id="more-857269"></span></p>
<p>As usual, we’ll kick things off by discussing our favorite releases first and then wrap things up with an outline of everything else afterward.</p>
<h2>Our favorite releases this week</h2>
<h3>14PiP – FREE</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-858194" src="https://cdn-0.idownloadblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/C82E0A60-12D3-412A-8DF5-A185BB2396AF.jpeg" alt width="400" height="508" srcset="https://cdn-0.idownloadblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/C82E0A60-12D3-412A-8DF5-A185BB2396AF.jpeg 828w, https://cdn-0.idownloadblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/C82E0A60-12D3-412A-8DF5-A185BB2396AF-169x215.jpeg 169w, https://cdn-0.idownloadblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/C82E0A60-12D3-412A-8DF5-A185BB2396AF-768x976.jpeg 768w, https://cdn-0.idownloadblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/C82E0A60-12D3-412A-8DF5-A185BB2396AF-394x500.jpeg 394w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></p>
<p><strong>14PiP</strong> is a simple and free jailbreak tweak for iOS & iPadOS 13 users that ports the newer, upgraded Picture-in-Picture interface from iOS & iPadOS 14 to the older operating system.</p>
<p>The newer interface not only makes better use of screen real estate, but looks aesthetically superior in virtually every way.</p>

<h3>LowLock – FREE</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-676282" src="https://cdn-0.idownloadblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Low-Power-Mode-iPhone.jpg" alt width="600" height="520" srcset="https://cdn-0.idownloadblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Low-Power-Mode-iPhone.jpg 1242w, https://cdn-0.idownloadblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Low-Power-Mode-iPhone-248x215.jpg 248w, https://cdn-0.idownloadblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Low-Power-Mode-iPhone-768x666.jpg 768w, https://cdn-0.idownloadblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Low-Power-Mode-iPhone-577x500.jpg 577w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></p>
<p>Low Power Mode is an awesome resource to get more out of your iPhone on a single charge, but it’s a feature that only kicks in when you toggle the feature on manually or when your handset’s battery level gets too low.</p>
<p><strong>LowLock</strong> is a free jailbreak tweak that makes Low Power Mode more autonomous, and it does this by automatically turning the feature on when you lock your handset and then off when you unlock your handset, wash and repeat. This way, you save power when you aren’t using your handset and can still enjoy all the best features when you’re using it.</p>

<p>You can learn more about LowLock and why it’s a great tweak invention <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/2021/03/17/lowlock/">in our full review</a>.</p>
<h3>QuickANC – FREE</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-858343" src="https://cdn-0.idownloadblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/QuickANC.jpg" alt width="550" height="444" srcset="https://cdn-0.idownloadblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/QuickANC.jpg 1125w, https://cdn-0.idownloadblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/QuickANC-255x206.jpg 255w, https://cdn-0.idownloadblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/QuickANC-768x620.jpg 768w, https://cdn-0.idownloadblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/QuickANC-619x500.jpg 619w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></p>
<p><strong>QuickANC</strong> is a useful extension for AirPods Pro and AirPods Max users that makes it easier to toggle between Active Noise Cancellation, Transparency, and ‘normal’ modes in a pinch.</p>
<p>The tweak adds anywhere from 1-3 new toggle buttons directly to the Now Playing widget, preventing you from needing to visit Control Center to access a toggle every time you feel like switching modes.</p>

<h3>WebShade – FREE</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-857997" src="https://cdn-0.idownloadblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/WebShade.jpg" alt width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://cdn-0.idownloadblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/WebShade.jpg 3372w, https://cdn-0.idownloadblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/WebShade-255x170.jpg 255w, https://cdn-0.idownloadblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/WebShade-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn-0.idownloadblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/WebShade-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://cdn-0.idownloadblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/WebShade-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn-0.idownloadblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/WebShade-745x497.jpg 745w, https://cdn-0.idownloadblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/WebShade-360x240.jpg 360w, https://cdn-0.idownloadblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/WebShade-720x480.jpg 720w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></p>
<p>Dark Mode is one of my favorite features from the past several iterations of iOS and iPadOS, but one place where it really stops short is with regard to web pages.</p>
<p>Indeed, there’s nothing quite like enjoying Dark Mode elsewhere in iOS or iPadOS just to have your eyes seared in their sockets after loading your favorite web page in Safari, and a new and free jailbreak tweak dubbed <strong>WebShade</strong> helps solve this problem by implementing a mostly-universal Dark Mode for the web pages you visit most.</p>
