<p>With a personalized radio station, <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/tag/apple-music/">Apple Music</a> typically utilizes an individual user’s profile picture for the cover artwork. But it looks like Apple’s decided to go a different route now.<span id="more-858233"></span></p>
<p>As first noted recently by folks on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AppleMusic/comments/m83bgp/did_apple_really_remove_the_profile_pictures_out/">Reddit</a> (via <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/19/apple-music-scraps-personalized-artwork-stations/"><em>MacRumors</em></a>), Apple Music has opted to adopt a more uniform artwork style for the personalized radio station. As you can see in the image below, it all looks a bit more generic. There’s a Play symbol, with a range of circles expanding away from it.</p>

<p>Nothing too exciting, honestly. Not that the original artwork was too eye-catching in its own right, considering it was just the profile picture. But with Apple Music leaning into <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/2020/07/07/ios-14-apple-music-animated-playlist-artwork/">more animated cover artwork</a> for other playlists, the company could’ve done the same thing for the personalized radio station, too.</p>

<p>It’s possible this is just a minor change leading to something bigger, like animated options. But, as it stands right now, it seems like a strange change. The good news is that artist-focused stations aren’t seeing the same changes, at least for now.</p>
<p>What do you think of the new personalized station album artwork?</p>
