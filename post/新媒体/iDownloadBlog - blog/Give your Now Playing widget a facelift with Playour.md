<p>If you’re jailbroken and you’re interested in adding a splash of color or personality to your iPhone or iPad’s <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/tag/now-playing">Now Playing</a> widget, then we’ve got just the thing for you!</p>
<p><strong>Playour</strong> is a newly released <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/tag/jailbreak-apps-tweaks">jailbreak tweak</a> by iOS developer <em>popsicletreehouse</em> that lets users customize the background, color, and border properties of the Now Playing widget.</p>

<p><span id="more-858353"></span></p>
<p>Many different aesthetics are possible with the Playour tweak, whether you fancy something colorful, a simple background image swap, or outlines that pop against your wallpaper. Some concepts are provided as samples in the screenshot examples below:</p>

<p>Notably, Playour doesn’t impact the Now Playing widget’s core functionality, so it’ll continue serving the same purpose you’ve gotten accustomed to all this time… it’ll just look better while doing it.</p>
<p>Once installed, Playour adds a dedicated preference pane to the Settings app where you can configure the tweak to your liking:</p>
