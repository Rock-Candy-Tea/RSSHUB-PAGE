<p>It’s been a bit of a rollercoaster for the <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/tag/imac-pro/">iMac Pro</a> in its last few weeks of life. But, with March about ready to wrap up, it looks like the final nail is in the coffin for the powerful desktop machine.<span id="more-858324"></span></p>
<p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/2021/03/08/imac-pro-supplies-last-discontinued/">we reported</a> that Apple planned to discontinue the iMac Pro once stock ran out. On that same date, and for a few days after, availability came and went. But, as of today, it looks like the computer is now finally officially discontinued. For good (via <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/19/imac-pro-officially-discontinued/"><em>MacRumors</em></a>)</p>

<p>At the time of publication, the iMac Pro is no longer available to buy from Apple’s website. What’s more, as if there needed to be any other signs of the computer’s fate, it’s not even listed on the company’s site anymore at all. The iMac Pro went out of stock earlier today, and, with that, Apple has finally decided to pull the plug.</p>

<p>While new models aren’t available, there is still an option to get your hands on one. And from Apple directly, no less. The company still has various options for the powerful desktop machine available in the <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/refurbished/mac/imac-pro">refurbished storefront</a>. If you go that route, prices start at $3,819.00. That’s a savings of $680.</p>
<p>When Apple confirmed the discontinuation of the iMac Pro, the company suggested folks look at the current 27-inch iMac. However, it’s worth noting that Apple is reportedly working on a major refresh for the iMac, one involving a new hardware design and adopting the M-series processor. So, if you’re in the market for a new Mac, it might be with waiting a bit longer if you can.</p>
