<p>If you have a pair of <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/tag/airpods-pro">AirPods Pro</a> or <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/tag/airpods-max">AirPods Max</a> at your disposal, then chances are you’ve become somewhat fond of their <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/2019/11/15/airpods-pro-active-noise-cancellation-transparency/">Active Noise Cancellation and Transparency modes</a>. The only problem? – Switching between those modes in a pinch, especially in rapid succession, tends to be a cumbersome two-step process.</p>
<p>Recognizing that this process could do with some refinements, iOS developer <em>exodia9610</em> conceived a new and free <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/tag/jailbreak-apps-tweaks">jailbreak tweak</a> known as <strong>QuickANC</strong>.</p>

<p><span id="more-858341"></span></p>
<p>In a nutshell, QuickANC makes it easier for AirPods Pro and AirPods Max users to switch between Active Noise Cancellation, Transparency, and ‘normal’ modes. It does this by adding up to three new buttons to your iPhone or iPad’s native <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/tag/now-playing">Now Playing</a> widget, as depicted in the screenshot example below:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-858343" src="https://cdn-0.idownloadblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/QuickANC.jpg" alt width="550" height="444" srcset="https://cdn-0.idownloadblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/QuickANC.jpg 1125w, https://cdn-0.idownloadblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/QuickANC-255x206.jpg 255w, https://cdn-0.idownloadblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/QuickANC-768x620.jpg 768w, https://cdn-0.idownloadblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/QuickANC-619x500.jpg 619w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></p>
<p>Before installing QuickANC, you’d have to launch <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/tag/control-center">Control Center</a> and then interact with the dedicated toggle each time you wanted to switch between Active Noise Cancellation and Transparency mode. It’s not too difficult of a process in and of itself, but when the process becomes repetitive because the person beside you won’t keep quiet, that’s where the irritation sets in and an easier solution would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>By default, QuickANC only displays one button – essentially to switch to the mode you aren’t already using and intend to switch to, but you can configure the tweak to display all three modes at the same time, which could be useful if you don’t feel like using Active Noise Cancellation or Transparency.</p>

<p>That configuration, along with a toggle to turn the tweak on or off on demand, appears in the dedicated preference pane that you’ll find in the Settings app post-installation:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-858342" src="https://cdn-0.idownloadblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/QuickANC-Prefs.jpg" alt width="550" height="288" srcset="https://cdn-0.idownloadblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/QuickANC-Prefs.jpg 1124w, https://cdn-0.idownloadblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/QuickANC-Prefs-255x133.jpg 255w, https://cdn-0.idownloadblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/QuickANC-Prefs-768x402.jpg 768w, https://cdn-0.idownloadblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/QuickANC-Prefs-745x390.jpg 745w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></p>
<p>It’s important to note that QuickANC is only intended for the AirPods Pro and AirPods Max since it depends on their native Active Noise Cancellation and Transparency modes to operate. With that in mind, if you have the <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/tag/airpods">AirPods</a> or AirPods 2, then this tweak won’t apply to you since these devices don’t support the aforementioned modes.</p>
<p>If you’re interested in giving QuickANC a try, then it’s <a href="https://repo.packix.com/package/com.exodia9610.quickanc">available for free from the Packix repository</a> via any package manager of your choosing. The tweak supports <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/jailbreak">jailbroken</a> iOS & iPadOS 13 and 14 devices only.</p>
