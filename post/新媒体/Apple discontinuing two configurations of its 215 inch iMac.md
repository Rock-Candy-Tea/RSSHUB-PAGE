  <p id="fGSntk">Apple recently <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/6/22316831/apple-store-imac-pro-base-model-while-supplies-last">discontinued the iMac Pro,</a> and two configurations of the 21.5-inch iMac are now joining the Pro in retirement. As spotted <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/20/512gb-1tb-ssd-imac-21-discontinued/">by <em>MacRumors</em></a>, the 512GB and 1TB SSD configurations of the 21.5-inch iMac are no longer available for purchase, with only the 256GB SSD and 1TB Fusion drive versions available to buy on Apple’s website. </p>
<p id="zlNXBM">Both configurations appeared <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/25/21-5-inch-imac-ssd-upgrades-unavailable/">unavailable for purchase</a> on Apple’s website as of last month, but at the time it was not clear if that was a supply issue or a permanent discontinuation of the two options. But now both the 512GB and 1TB SSD options are gone from the iMac configuration page, <em>MacRumors</em> notes. </p>
<p id="ugEhbO">A big iMac redesign has been rumored in the works for some time. Apple is expected to replace the 27-inch and 21.5-inch versions of the iMac with a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22233191/apple-silicon-redesigned-imac-mac-pro-rumor-features">redesigned iMac</a> and will likely revamp the Mac Pro sometime this year. In January, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-15/apple-plans-redesigned-imac-new-mac-pro-smaller-mac-pro-cheaper-monitor?sref=ExbtjcSG"><em>Bloomberg </em>reported</a> that the update would have a flat-back design and do away with the “chin” beneath the screen.</p>
<p id="VuOIe5">The new iMacs are expected to use Apple silicon chips, as the company continues to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21295475/apple-mac-processors-arm-silicon-chips-wwdc-2020">shift away from Intel chips</a>. </p>
