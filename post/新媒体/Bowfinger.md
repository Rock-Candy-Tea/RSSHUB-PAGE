<div><p>A DVD that lived on the top of my parents' collection for most of my childhood. If I'd actually watched it back then it'd absolutely be one of my favorites now. I'm a sucker for any movie about movies, even one as cynical as this. All it takes is the moment where Steve Martin stares at the screen near the end and I feel warm inside.</p><p>Obviously Eddie Murphy is one of the best comedic actors to ever do it but damn, it's really a thing to behold. He's so good at just the body language of a character that Jiff immediately feels like a different person, never to be confused with Kit. It works so well I genuinely felt bad during the highway scene. Eddie Murphy funny! Steve Martin funny! Ready to finally ignite the discourse on this.</p></div>
