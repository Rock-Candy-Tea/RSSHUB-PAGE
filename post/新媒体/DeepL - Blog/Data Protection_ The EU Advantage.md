<p>You have probably already seen the incredible difference in quality between DeepL Translator and translation services offered by our competitors. Even better; as a company based in the European Union, DeepL offers you additional benefits when it comes to privacy and confidentiality. Neither source texts, nor their translations, can be obtained by foreign authorities.</p>     <p>EU data protection laws put user protection front and center; we are prohibited from collecting personal data without reason. And, should an EU-based company ever experience a security breach concerning users' data, they are required to inform customers within 72 hours of learning of the incident.</p>     <p>With the new <a href="https://www.deepl.com/pro.html">DeepL Pro</a> service, to be launched in March, we will add another layer of data security. We guarantee every DeepL Pro subscriber that we never store the texts they translate. With this guarantee, under European Union law, you can be sure that you and your clients' texts are as secure as possible.</p>     <p>     The security of company reports, patents, corporate emails, and customer data is of utmost importance. DeepL guarantees that such documents are treated with the sensitivity and confidentiality that you and your customers deserve.</p>     <p>You care about the privacy of the texts you translate. So do we.</p>
