<p>     DeepL Pro has proven to be a great success, with thousands of companies and professionals finding it to be their ideal translation solution.     We are thrilled to announce that we have now revamped our pricing model to allow even more people to get on board with DeepL Pro and the features that come along with it.     It is also possible to test it out with a 30-day free trial. </p> <p>     Rather than offering a single payment model, we now have several options, which can be adapted to meet your needs.     The most modest plan, <b>Starter</b>, begins at just €5.99 per month, but still allows for unlimited use of the Web Translator and includes 5 document translations. </p> <p>     People looking to translate more, such as professional translators, should opt for either the <b>Advanced</b> or <b>Ultimate</b> plan, which include more document translations, and allow you to use DeepL Pro in computer-assisted translation (CAT) tools. </p> <p>     One of the most common requests we have received has been for a solution for teams or whole companies needing to translate with DeepL Pro.     By signing up for a team plan, you give access to all your colleagues and allow them to use all the features of DeepL Pro; unlimited Web Translator use, a shared pool of document translations, and multiple licenses for CAT tool integration. </p> <p>     One of the things that excites us the most is seeing what other people create based on DeepL’s translation technology.     Several developers have already started building new applications and programs using the DeepL API.     In order to support further creativity, we offer the <b>DeepL API</b> plan specifically for developers. </p> <p>     Whether you are a software developer with a great idea for a cool new app, a professional translator who handles several thousand words a day, a student who needs to translate only a couple documents, or a business owner who needs to connect with international clients, DeepL Pro is the tool for you.     Its powerful features, world-class quality, and flexible conditions will help you take your projects to the next level. </p> <p>     Take a look at all the <a href="https://www.deepl.com/pro.html#pricing">DeepL Pro plans</a> and find the one that’s right for you! </p>
