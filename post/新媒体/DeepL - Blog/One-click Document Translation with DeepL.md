<p>     Wouldn’t it be great if you could translate a full file into another language without losing all of those carefully-placed images and font styles? Today, we are rolling out this new feature as part of our free service. </p> <p>     Whether you are a student needing to translate your thesis, a professional preparing a presentation in a foreign language, or a company providing user manuals to a global audience, DeepL translates your documents at the click of a button, to the world-class standard you’ve come to expect from us. </p> <p>     DeepL can handle Microsoft Word (.docx) and PowerPoint (.pptx) files. All elements of the document, including body text, titles, captions, and even footnotes, will be translated into the language of your choice, while conserving the original formatting. </p> <p>     The document translator is extremely intuitive and easy to use. Simply drag the file to be translated into the input field on the left, as shown below: </p> <div class="docTrans_blog__drag_and_drop_screenshot"></div> <p>     Once you have uploaded your file, select the language into which the file should be translated. The translation will then begin automatically, as you can see: </p> <div class="docTrans_blog__progress_screenshot"></div> <p>     Alternatively, hover your mouse cursor over the “Translate document” button at the bottom left of the input field and select the language you want to translate the document into, as shown below: </p> <div class="docTrans_blog__select_document_screenshot"></div> <p>     Select your document and DeepL will take care of the rest. Once finished, the translated document will be automatically downloaded. </p> <p>     As a DeepL Pro subscriber, you can further edit the downloaded file.
