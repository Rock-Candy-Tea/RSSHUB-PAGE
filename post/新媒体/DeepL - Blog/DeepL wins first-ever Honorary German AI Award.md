<p>     The night of September 26th was very special for DeepL. In a ceremony at Factory Berlin am Görlitzer Park, DeepL was awarded the first-ever Honorary AI Award at the inaugural German AI Awards (Deutscher KI-Preis). To say that we are honored would be an understatement. Being singled out for this award is an extremely gratifying recognition of our efforts over the past two years.     </p>     <p>     The German AI Awards were created by Bilanz Magazin with the support of Airbus, BMW Group, Maschmeyer Group, McKinsey & Company, Otto Group, and Presight Capital. In addition to the Honorary Award awarded to DeepL, Dr. Elmar Rückert of the University of Lübeck won the Development Award, and Professor Dr. Kristian Kersting of the “Machine Learning Lab” at the Technical University of Darmstadt took home the Grand Prize.     </p>     <p>     “We are extremely grateful to Bilanz Magazin and the German AI Awards jury. On behalf of everyone at DeepL, thank you very much!” said DeepL CEO Jaroslaw Kutylowski. “I’d like to congratulate the other award winners and all the nominees, as well. We look forward to seeing the exciting AI developments they are working on.”     </p>     <p>     The German AI Awards are an excellent initiative to promote and drive innovation in artificial intelligence and show that Germany has incredible potential to be a world leader in this field. We at DeepL are thrilled to be at the forefront of artificial intelligence research worldwide, and to be Germany’s leading AI company.     </p>     <p>     We view the Honorary AI Award as confirmation that DeepL is a prime example not only of highly-advanced AI technology, but also a meaningful application of that technology that helps millions of people in their everyday lives.     </p>
