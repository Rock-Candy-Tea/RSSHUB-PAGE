<p>We're excited to share that DeepL Translator now supports thirteen new European languages: Bulgarian, Czech, Danish, Estonian, Finnish, Greek, Hungarian, Latvian, Lithuanian, Romanian, Slovak, Slovenian, and Swedish.</p>     <p>Over the years, many people have asked us to add more languages to our translator so that they could enjoy DeepL’s accurate translations. We’re thrilled to be able to honor several of those requests at once with the release of the new languages.</p>     <p>With this launch, DeepL can now reach an estimated 105 million more native speakers around the world with natural-sounding, high-quality translations. This allows us to further our company vision of breaking down language barriers and bringing cultures closer together.</p>     <p>We’re continually working to ensure the translation quality for all languages remains exceptional and that the translation process is seamless for all our users. And if your preferred language isn’t offered yet, don’t worry, we will add more languages in the future.</p>     <p>From “<a href="https://www.deepl.com/translator#hu/en/Sziasztok"><span lang="hu">Sziasztok</span></a>” to “<a href="https://www.deepl.com/translator#sv/en/Hej"><span lang="sv">Hej</span></a>”, we’re ready to say hello to our new users and are already looking forward to their feedback. All thirteen languages are now available on <a href="https://www.deepl.com/translator">DeepL.com</a>, via the DeepL API, and in our desktop apps, DeepL for Windows and DeepL for Mac.</p>     <p>Ready to try out the new languages for yourself?
