<p>     <i>Schönen Bundesfeiertag!</i> Or should we say <i>bonne fête nationale suisse</i>? Or maybe <i>buona Festa Nazionale Svizzera!</i>     </p>     <p>     No matter how you say it, today is the Swiss National Day, and there are thousands of reasons to celebrate. We at DeepL would like to add one more: Residents of Switzerland and Liechtenstein can now sign up for DeepL Pro!     </p>     <p>     Located at the heart of Europe, these two countries are highly international and well-connected. We’re extremely happy to now be able to serve such an important market for translation and language services.     </p>     <p>     We have had thousands of requests from Swiss businesses and professionals, but international trade is not as easy as we might like it to be. Now that we’ve sorted out the paperwork, we can get to the fun part: Providing DeepL Pro access to even more people.     </p>     <p>     As of today, all of our DeepL Pro subscription options are available in Switzerland and Liechtenstein: Individual plans, team subscriptions with multiple licenses, and the DeepL API plan for developers. Check out <a href="https://www.deepl.com/pro.html#pricing">all the options</a> and find the DeepL Pro subscription that works best for you and your business!     </p>     <p>     This is our first expansion to clients outside of the European Union, but it definitely won’t be the last.     </p>     <p>     Until then, happy Swiss National Day!     </p>
