<div><p>the first half is so complex and somewhat confusing compared to the very linear second half, and the structure of this film was not at all what i was expecting given the first two films in the vengeance trilogy. the storytelling is a lot less suspense/mystery-oriented. feel like i set myself up for failure expecting another film like the first two, but despite that i still really enjoyed it! that second half is fucking great; his ideas about the lingering disruption of vengeance are still on display here in a much more emotional/less physical way, which makes sense since this is the sole film where the vengeance is unidirectional. i like park chan-wook! i'm excited to finish out his filmography eventually, hopefully getting to enjoy them without preconceived notions of what they "should" be, like this one. like to see 'em try and beat the mf handmaiden though....</p></div>
