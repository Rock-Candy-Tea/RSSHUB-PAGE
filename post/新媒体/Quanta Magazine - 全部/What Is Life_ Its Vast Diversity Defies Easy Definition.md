In this excerpt from his new book,</em> Life’s Edge: The Search for What It Means to Be Alive<em>, published today, the science writer Carl Zimmer discusses scientists’ frustrated efforts to develop a universal definition of life.</em></p>
<p>“It is commonly said,” the scientists <a href="https://sci.esa.int/web/mars-express/-/49528-frances-westall">Frances Westall</a> and André Brack wrote in 2018, “that there are as many definitions of life as there are people trying to define it.”</p>
<p>As an observer of science and of scientists, I find this behavior strange. It is as if astronomers kept coming up with new ways to define stars. I once asked <a href="https://astrobiology.nasa.gov/nai/directory/popa-radu/index.html">Radu Popa</a>, a microbiologist who started collecting definitions of life in the early 2000s, what he thought of this state of affairs.</p>
<p>“This is intolerable for any science,” he replied. “You can take a science in which there are two or three definitions for one thing. But a science in which the most important object has no definition? That’s absolutely unacceptable. How are we going to discuss it if you believe that the definition of life has something to do with DNA, and I think it has something to do with dynamic systems? We cannot make artificial life because we cannot agree on what life is. We cannot find life on Mars because we cannot agree what life represents.”</p>
<p>With scientists adrift in an ocean of definitions, philosophers rowed out to offer lifelines.</p>
<p>Some tried to soothe the debate, assuring the scientists they could learn to live with the abundance. We have no need to zero in on the One True Definition of Life, they argued, because working definitions are good enough. NASA can come up with whatever definition helps them build the best machine for searching for life on other planets and moons. Physicians can use a different one to map the blurry boundary that sets life apart from death. “Their value does not depend on consensus, but rather on their impact on research,” the philosophers <a href="https://laslab.academia.edu/LeonardoBich">Leonardo Bich</a> and <a href="https://www.ind.ku.dk/english/staff-auto-list/?pure=en/persons/524942">Sara Green</a> argued.</p>

<p>Other philosophers found this way of thinking — known as operationalism — an intellectual cop‐out. Defining life was hard, yes, but that was no excuse not to try. “Operationalism may sometimes be unavoidable in practice,” the philosopher <a href="https://www.clemson.edu/caah/departments/philosophy-religion/people/facultyBio.html?id=542">Kelly Smith</a> countered, “but it simply cannot substitute for a proper definition of life.”</p>
<p>Smith and other foes of operationalism complain that such definitions rely on what a group of people generally agree on. But the most important research on life is at its frontier, where it will be hardest to come to an easy agreement. “Any experiment conducted without a clear idea of what it is looking for ultimately settles nothing,” Smith declared.</p>
<p>Smith argued that the best thing to do is to keep searching for a definition of life that everyone can get behind, one that succeeds where others have failed. But <a href="https://evo.haifa.ac.il/index.php/people/postdocs-and-graduate-students/39-people/former-members-of-the-institute/198-edward-n-trifonov-ph-d">Edward Trifonov</a>, a Russian‐born geneticist, wondered if a successful definition already exists but is lying hidden amidst all the past attempts.</p>
<p>In 2011, Trifonov reviewed 123 definitions of life. Each was different, but the same words showed up again and again in many of them. Trifonov analyzed the linguistic structure of the definitions and sorted them into categories. Beneath their variations, Trifonov found an underlying core. He concluded that all the definitions agreed on one thing: life is <em>self‐reproduction with variations</em>. What NASA’s scientists had done in eleven words <em>(“Life is a self‐sustained chemical system capable of undergoing Darwinian evolution”</em>), Trifonov now did with three.</p>
<p>His efforts did not settle matters. All of us — scientists included — keep a personal list of things that we consider to be alive and not alive. If someone puts forward a definition, we check our list to see where it draws that line. A number of scientists looked at Trifonov’s distilled definition and did not like the line’s location. “A computer virus performs self‐reproduction with variations. It is not alive,” declared the biochemist <a href="http://www.unice.fr/meierhenrich/">Uwe Meierhenrich</a>.</p>
<figure><img src="https://d2r55xnwy6nx47.cloudfront.net/uploads/2021/03/cleland_v1.jpg" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption><p>The philosopher Carol Cleland of the University of Colorado, Boulder, outraged many scientists with her argument that trying to define life was counterproductive to understanding it.</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>What started as a quick prep for a talk turned into a dive into the philosophy of extraterrestrial life. Cleland concluded that the fight over Allan Hills 84001 sprang from the divide between experimental and historical sciences. The critics made the mistake of treating the meteorite study as experimental science. It was absurd to expect McKay’s team to replay history. They couldn’t fossilize microbes on Mars for 4 billion years and see if they matched Allan Hills 84001. They couldn’t hurl a thousand asteroids at a thousand copies of Mars and see what came our way.</p>
<p>Cleland concluded that the NASA team had carried out good historical science, comparing explanations for the ones that explained their evidence best. “The martian‐life hypothesis is a very good candidate for being the best explanation of the structural and chemical features of the martian meteorite,” she wrote in 1997 in the <em>Planetary Report</em>.</p>
<p>Cleland’s work on the meteorite impressed Jakosky so much that he invited her in 1998 to join one of the teams at NASA’s newly created Astrobiology Institute. In the years that followed, Cleland developed a philosophical argument for what the science of astrobiology should look like. She informed her ideas by spending time with scientists doing different kinds of research that fit under the umbrella of astrobiology. She traveled around the Australian outback with a paleontologist searching for clues to how giant mammals went extinct 40,000 years ago. She went to Spain to learn how geneticists sequence DNA. And she spent a lot of time at scientific meetings, roaming from talk to talk. “I felt like a kid in a candy store,” she once told me.</p>
<p>But sometimes the scientists Cleland spent time with set off her philosophical alarms. “Everybody was working with a definition of life,” she recalled. NASA’s definition, only a few years old at that point, was especially popular.</p>
<p>As a philosopher, Cleland recognized that the scientists were making a mistake. Their error didn’t have to do with determinate attributes or some other fine philosophical point understood only by a few logicians. It was a fundamental blunder that got in the way of the science itself. Cleland laid out the nature of this mistake in a paper, and in 2001 she traveled to Washington, D.C., to deliver it at a meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. She stood up before an audience made up mostly of scientists, and told them it was pointless to try to find a definition of life.</p>
<div id="component-60580bdf33e5c" class></div>
<p>“There was an explosion,” Cleland recalled. “Everyone was yelling at me. It was really amazing. Everyone had their pet definitions and wanted to air them. And here I told them the whole definition project was worthless.”</p>
<p>Fortunately, some people who heard Cleland talk thought she was onto something. She began collaborating with astrobiologists to explore the implications of her ideas. Over the course of two decades she published a series of papers, culminating in a book, <em>The Quest for a Universal Theory of Life</em>.</p>
<p>The trouble that scientists had with defining life had nothing to do with the particulars of life’s hallmarks such as homeostasis or evolution. It had to do with the nature of definitions themselves — something that scientists rarely stopped to consider. “Definitions,” Cleland wrote, “are not the proper tools for answering the scientific question ‘what is life?’”</p>
<p>Definitions serve to organize our concepts. The definition of, say, a bachelor is straightforward: an unmarried man. If you’re a man and you’re unmarried, you are — by definition — a bachelor. Being a man is not enough to make you a bachelor, nor is being unmarried. As for what it means to be a man, well, that can get complicated. And marriage has its own complexity. But we can define “bachelor” without getting bogged down in those messy matters. The word simply links these concepts in a precise way. And because definitions have such a narrow job to do, we can’t revise them through scientific investigation. There is simply no way that we could ever discover that we were wrong about the definition of a bachelor as being an unmarried man.</p>
<div id="component-60580bdf34a7a" class="related-list"></div>
<p>Life is different. It is not the sort of thing that can be defined simply by linking together concepts. As a result, it’s futile to search for a laundry list of features that will turn out to be the real definition of life. “We don’t want to know what the word <em>life </em>means to us,” Cleland said. “We want to know what life <em>is</em>.” And if we want to satisfy our desire, Cleland argues, we need to give up our search for a definition.</p>
