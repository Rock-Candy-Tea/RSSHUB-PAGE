Today, they’ve grown so close it’s hard to find the line between them. For their many fundamental contributions to both fields, and for their work drawing them together, today Lovász and Wigderson were awarded the <a href="https://www.abelprize.no/">Abel Prize</a>, an honor given out by the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters and regarded as one of the highest honors in mathematics.</p>
<p>“In many ways their work is complementary. Avi is on the computer science side and Lovász is on the mathematics side, but a lot of the issues they work on are related,” said <a href="http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~russell/">Russell Impagliazzo</a>, a computer scientist at the University of California, San Diego who has collaborated with both researchers.</p>
<p>The opportunity for this pairing to occur at all was a result of the unique period in scientific history in which they both grew up.</p>
<p>Wigderson was born in Haifa, Israel, in 1956. By the time he was a teenager, computer scientists were just beginning to sketch a basic theoretical framework that would end up absorbing much of his professional life. That framework, called complexity theory, involves <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/a-short-guide-to-hard-problems-20180716/">classifying computational problems</a> based on how hard they are for algorithms to solve. The primary measure of difficulty is the number of computational steps, with the most basic distinction being “easy” versus “hard.”</p>

<p>Born in Budapest in 1948, Lovász was a mathematics star from an early age. As a teenager he earned three gold medals at the International Math Olympiad and also triumphed in a Hungarian game show that put math prodigies inside glass isolation booths and challenged them to solve problems.</p>
<p>Also early in his life, Lovász met the influential Hungarian mathematician Paul Erdős, who helped introduce him to the field of graph theory. At the time, graph theory was a mathematical backwater, known for posing fun problems like the four-color conjecture (<a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/mathematicians-closer-to-perfect-graph-coloring-theorem-20151020/">now a proved theorem</a>), which asks whether it’s always possible to color the countries in any map with only four colors and have no two adjacent countries with the same color.</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t call it obscure, but certainly graph theory was not mainstream mathematics because many of the problems or results arose from puzzles or sort of recreational mathematics,” said Lovász, who is now at Eötvös Loránd University in Hungary. But things were already changing by the time Lovász earned his doctorate in 1970 at the age of 22 — and a main reason was the birth and rapid growth of computer science.</p>
<p>Computers, by necessity, work with discrete quantities — binary strings of 1s and 0s. Combinatorics is the mathematics of discrete objects, and one of its main subfields is graph theory, which studies networks of edges (lines) connecting vertices (dots). As such, it provided a kind of language for investigating emerging questions in theoretical computer science.</p>
<div id="component-6058126890bde" class></div>
<p>Lovász views the rise of computers and graph theory as a propitious historical concurrence, on par with the way analysis (an advanced form of calculus) came of age more than a century earlier through the investigation of urgent physical questions.</p>
<p>“I sometimes use the analogy to analysis and physics in the 18th and 19th centuries, where they sort of grew hand by hand,” said Lovász. “There’s something similar that happened in graph theory and computer science.”</p>
<p>Much of Lovász’s work has centered around the development of algorithms for solving different kinds of problems. One of his most influential results was the LLL algorithm, named for its creators, Lovász and the brothers Arjen and Hendrik Lenstra. The algorithm works on geometric objects called lattices, which are sets of points in space whose coordinates often have integer values. The LLL algorithm addresses a basic question about their properties: Which point in the lattice is closest to the origin? It’s a simple question that’s often hard to solve, especially in higher-dimensional spaces and when the points in the lattice create a distorted shape.</p>
<p>Instead of answering the question exactly, the LLL algorithm finds a good approximation, identifying a point and providing assurance that there is no other point that’s much closer to the origin. Due to the wide applicability of this geometric model, the ability to find this point has implications in a wide range of settings, from factoring polynomials to testing the security of cryptographic systems.</p>
<p>“It’s one of the fundamental algorithms. It’s important both theoretically and it’s used for many practical purposes,” said <a href="http://www.ma.huji.ac.il/~kalai/">Gil Kalai</a> of IDC Herzliya and the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, who was previously a member of the Abel Prize committee.</p>

<p>Another of Lovász’s most significant contributions has a probabilistic flavor to it. In the 1960s Paul Erdős developed what came to be called the probabilistic method for answering questions about graphs. Often mathematicians want to know whether a graph with certain properties exists. One way to answer these questions is to actually find a graph that does. But Erdős realized that another approach was merely to prove that a graph chosen at random will have this property with high probability.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Erdős’ probabilistic method worked best at establishing the existence of graphs that are already common. In the 1970s, Lovász collaborated with Erdős to devise a complementary technique, called the Lovász local lemma, that works for proving the existence of graphs that are very rare. It’s since become one of the staple techniques in the field.</p>
<p>“This is a tool that was used hundreds, thousands of times in subsequent proofs,” said Kalai.</p>
<p>Lovász has solved many other problems in graph theory over the course of his career, including Kneser’s conjecture, about the minimum number of colors needed for coloring a certain graph, and a question about the conditions that guarantee perfect matchings and related structures in graphs. He also generated several conjectures of his own that are still guiding the field of graph theory today. These include two problems, the <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/statistics-postdoc-tames-decades-old-geometry-problem-20210301/">KLS conjecture</a> and the EFL conjecture, that saw big results only within the last few months.</p>
<div id="component-6058126891790" class="related-list"></div>
<p>During the same years that pioneers like Wigderson were refining our understanding of computational complexity, Lovász was answering questions about graphs that helped define the borders between one complexity class and another.</p>
<p>“These complexity concepts were manifested by very simple questions about graphs,” said Kalai. “So questions about graphs became very prominent, and Lovász studied these from the beginning.”</p>
<p>And so it’s fitting that two pioneers who brought their respective fields together are now joined in another way, by the Abel Prize.</p>
