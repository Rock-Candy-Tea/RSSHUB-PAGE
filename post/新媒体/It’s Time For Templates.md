It’s a canvas of opportunity, full of infinite possibilities. But often times a blank page isn’t what you need. Sometimes you want a little structure and direction to guide you. Which is why we’re thrilled to announce that templates have officially arrived as part of our Version 4.2 release.</p><p>You will now have access to a Day One managed Templates Gallery, built right inside the app, that will be updated over time with new templates. You'll also be able to create and save your own templates. Templates have been a requested feature by many faithful users and can help users overcome writers block, capture information quickly, track items/routines/changes over time, and help form a consistent journaling habit. Version 4.2 is launching with 6 templates to get you started and also provide inspiration for your own templates.</p><ul><li>Day Summary</li><li>Daily Plan</li><li>Daily Self</li><li>5 Minute AM</li><li>5 Minute PM</li><li>Meals</li></ul><p>Our support team has put together a <a href="http://help.dayoneapp.com/en/articles/2924432-templates">helpful guide</a> on how to find, create, and use templates. We can’t wait to see the different templates our users come up with and how it changes the way Day One is used. If you create a particularly helpful or clever template, we’d love to see it for consideration in our managed Templates Gallery for all users. You can copy and paste the template or send a screenshot to <a href="mailto:info@dayoneapp.com">info@dayoneapp.com</a>
. You can also post your custom templates on Twitter, Facebook, or Instagram with the hashtag #dayonetemplate.</p>
