    <div style="text-align: center;"><b>Executive Summary</b></div><div> </div><div style="text-align: center; "> <img src="http://www.chinalaborwatch.org/upfile/2019_08_07/VSHZ3634.JPG" width="600" height="450" alt referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></div><div> </div><div></div><p style="0in;.0001pt; normal"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman", serif;"></span></p><p style="0in;.0001pt; normal"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman", serif;">In 2018, China Labor Watch (CLW) conducted an investigation into Hengyang Foxconn. The investigation found the factory recruited a large number of dispatch workers, which was well over the legal limit, forced workers to work excessive overtime, among other rights violations. Amazon and Foxconn responded that they would make improvements to the factory’s working conditions. However, CLW’s 2019 investigation found that Foxconn’s working conditions have deteriorated. Workers put in more overtime hours, wages decreased, and the factory illegally recruited a large number of dispatch workers and interns. Interns were forced to work overtime and night shifts. According to workers, the factory is preparing to move a production line to Vietnam in September.</span></p>    <p style="0in;.0001pt; normal"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman", serif;">Key issues in this year’s investigation - </span></p>  <p style="0in;.0001pt; normal"><u> </u></p>  <p style="0in;.0001pt; normal"><u><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman", serif;">Interns</span></u><u></u></p>    <p style="0in;.0001pt; normal"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman", serif;">On July 26<sup>th</sup>, 2019, Foxconn already recruited 1581 interns from vocational schools, and the factory is currently recruiting more. The interns earned 1750 RMB/month ($248), or 10.05RMB/hour ($1.42/hour), when in 2018, they earned 1950 RMB ($276). Compared with 2018, interns in 2019 did not receive living stipends and employment rewards, in addition to other bonuses. If interns put in 234 hours a month, then in 2018 the labor cost was 5186 RMB ($735), but in 2019, this decreased to 3872.04 RMB ($548). Schools sending interns to work at the factory included Sinosteel Hengyang Heavy Machinery Workers Technical College, Hengyang Technician College, Hengyang Vocational Secondary School, Hengyang Industrial Workers College, Hengnan County Technical School. Interns are required to work 10 hours a day, and this includes two hours of overtime, in addition to working six days a week. A number of interns were arranged to work night shifts. If interns were unwilling to work overtime or night shifts, the factory would arrange for teachers to pressure workers. For interns who refuse to work overtime and night shifts, the factory requests teachers from their schools to fire them. Teachers often physically and verbally attack interns, and on July 30, many workers witnessed a teacher hitting an intern. The teacher aggressively grabbed the intern by the ear, did not let him swipe out of work and scolded him. To coordinate with the factory’s production, teachers who were assigned to the factory gave interns immense pressure. These teachers were also provided a 3000 RMB ($425) subsidy from the factory. The school received 3RMB ($0.42) for every hour an intern worked. </span></p><p style="0in;.0001pt; normal"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman", serif;"></span></p><div style="text-align: center; "><img src="http://www.chinalaborwatch.org/upfile/2019_08_07/IMG_2952.jpg" width="350" height="469" alt referrerpolicy="no-referrer">  <img src="http://www.chinalaborwatch.org/upfile/2019_08_07/IMG_2953.jpg" width="350" height="468" alt referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></div><div> </div><div style="text-align: center; ">Interns at the factory </div><div><u><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman", serif;"></span></u></div><p style="0in;.0001pt; normal"><u><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman", serif;">Dispatch Workers</span></u><u></u></p>    <p style="0in;.0001pt; normal"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman", serif;">On July 26<sup>th</sup>, 2019, the factory had 2545 dispatch workers, which is 34.2% of the total number of workers. In 2018, CLW’s report revealed that the factory had hired a high number of dispatch workers, violating Chinese labor law. Workers also put in excessive overtime hours. Amazon issued a response stating that after an initial investigation and audit, Hengyang Foxconn factory had violated Chinese labor laws, hiring a large number of temporary workers. However, after one year, there has yet to be any improvement to Foxconn’s illegal recruitment practices. Currently, there are several dispatch companies such as Qizhong, Feihong, Huahuisheng, Ningbo Tiankun helping Foxconn recruit temporary workers. The dispatch workers pay rate is 14.50 RMB/hour ($2.06/hour) this year, and for every hour they work at the factory, the dispatch company will receive a bonus of 3.5 RMB ($0.50) from Foxconn. </span></p>  <p style="0in;.0001pt; normal"><u> </u></p>  <p style="0in;.0001pt; normal"><u><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman", serif;">Overtime Hours </span></u><u></u></p>    <p style="0in;.0001pt; normal"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman", serif;">The factory uses a two-shift system: a day shift and night shift. During off peak season, workers have to work between 60 to 80 overtime hours a month and receive one day off a week. During peak season, overtime hours were between 80 to 140 hours a month. Peak season begins in July every year. According to the Responsible Business Alliance, work hours should be limited to 60 hours per week, including overtime, and workers should have at least one day off a week. However, according to the information we received, in July 2019, there were 375 workers violating this overtime standard. The factory has to produce a large number of orders for Amazon in August, hence workers have been working overtime recently. Many production line workers have put in over 60 hours a week and do not receive a day of rest a week. In order to finish the production goal, some workers only had two days off for the entire month in July. </span></p>    <p style="0in;.0001pt; normal"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman", serif;">We found that some of the working conditions at Hengyang Foxconn remained the same. The factory deducts 400 RMB in social insurance fees from regular workers’ wages every month, six workers share a dormitory room and workers are still unfamiliar with the labor union and do not know of any worker representatives. </span></p>    <p style="0in;.0001pt; normal"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman", serif;">CLW’s Executive Director, Li Qiang, says: “Despite being illegal, Foxconn still recruits a high number of dispatch workers and interns as a means to cut labor costs. China’s labor laws are also not strictly enforced.” </span></p>            <p align="center" style="0in;.0001pt; text-align:center;normal"><b><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman", serif;">Violations at Amazon’s supplier factory Foxconn</span></b></p>    <ol style="0in" start="1" type="1">  <li style="0in;.0001pt;auto;normal;l0 level1 lfo1"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman", serif; background: white;">Interns working night shifts: Although      regular workers are working night shifts, Foxconn is still experiencing a      labor shortage. Hence, interns are required to work night shifts. Some      interns were unwilling to work overtime and night shifts. The night shift      leaders and school teachers gave pressure to interns, and for those who      still refused to work overtime and night shifts, teachers helped the      factory fire the interns. (Picture 2</span><span style="font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;"Times New Roman";background:white">,11 and 14 in report.)      This violates Article 16 of “The Administrative Provisions On the      Internships of Vocational School Students”, which stipulates that “employers      must not arrange overtime work and night shifts      for students”. </span></li> </ol>    <ol style="0in" start="2" type="1">  <li style="0in;.0001pt;auto;normal;l0 level1 lfo1"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman", serif; background: white;">Interns working overtime: Interns will contribute      to completing the production goal, as such, interns need to work overtime.      A number of interns put in 10 hours a day, which includes eight regular      work hours and two hours of overtime. (Picture 2 in report.) This      violates Article 16 of “The Administrative Provisions On the Internships      of Vocational School Students”, which stipulates that “employers must not      arrange overtime work and night shifts for students”. </span></li> </ol>    <ol style="0in" start="3" type="1">  <li style="0in;.0001pt;auto;normal;l0 level1 lfo1"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman", serif; background: white;">Intern wages have decreased: In 2018, the      base wage was 1950 RMB ($276), the employment bonus was 200 RMB/month      ($28/month), and the living stipend was 100 RMB/month ($14/month); in      2019, the base wage for students was 1750 RMB ($248) and they received      less subsidies and bonuses compared to 2018. </span></li> </ol>    <ol style="0in" start="4" type="1">  <li style="0in;.0001pt;auto;normal;l0 level1 lfo1"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman", serif; background: white;">Regular workers wages have decreased: In 2018,      the base wage was 1950 RMB ($276), there was a 200 RMB/month ($28/month)      recruitment bonus and a 100 RMB/month ($14/month) living stipend; in 2019,      regular workers’ wages were 1750 RMB ($248) and they received less      subsidies and bonuses compared to 2018. </span></li> </ol>    <ol style="0in" start="5" type="1">  <li style="0in;.0001pt;auto;normal;l0 level1 lfo1"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman", serif; background: white;">Proportion of dispatch workers exceeds legal      limits: There are currently 7435 workers in total, which includes 2545      dispatch workers. Hence, dispatch workers make up 34.2% of the      workforce. (Picture 25 in report). This violates Article 4 of the “Interim      Provisions on Labor Dispatch”, which states, “employers are to      strictly control the number of dispatch workers they employ. The number of      dispatch workers must not exceed 10% of the workforce”. </span></li> </ol>    <ol style="0in" start="6" type="1">  <li style="0in;.0001pt;auto;normal;l0 level1 lfo1"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman", serif; background: white;">Proportion of interns exceeds legal limits:      There are currently 7435 workers in total, which includes 1581 interns.      Interns make up 21.3% of the workforce. (Picture 25 in report). This      violates Article 9 of “The Administrative Provisions On the Internships of      Vocational School Students”, which stipulates that “the number of interns      shall not exceed 10% of the total number of employees in the company.”</span></li> </ol>    <ol style="0in" start="7" type="1">  <li style="0in;.0001pt;auto;normal;l0 level1 lfo1"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman", serif; background: white;">Teachers staying at the factory with      students, cooperated with the factory to force interns to work overtime      and night shifts, as the factory provides an additional 3000 RMB/month      ($425) subsidy to every teacher. (Picture 2 in report)</span></li> </ol>    <ol style="0in" start="8" type="1">  <li style="0in;.0001pt;auto;normal;l0 level1 lfo1"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman", serif; background: white;">The school cooperated with the factory to      deliver large numbers of interns, and ignored the fact that the factory      was forcing interns to work overtime and night shifts. The factory paid an      additional 3 RMB($0.42)/ hour/person subsidy to school, for three months      in total. (Picture 11 in report)</span></li> </ol>    <ol style="0in" start="9" type="1">  <li style="0in;.0001pt;auto;normal;l0 level1 lfo1"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman", serif; background: white;">Excessive overtime work without any rest      days: The factory usually restricts work hours to 60 hours a week,      including overtime. Workers will not be able to clock into work once they      have recorded 60 work hours a week. However, when the factory receives a      large number of orders, each department will remove this work hour      restriction, and allow workers to clock in to work despite already putting      in 60 hours that week. At the same time, 375 workers were asked to work      overtime on Sunday and did not receive any rest days during the week.      (Picture 25 in report). This violates Article 3 of the “Responsible      Business Alliance”, which stipulates that “total hours worked should not      exceed local or national standards, or 60 hours per week, whichever is      stricter. Workers need to have at least a scheduled day off in every 7      days”</span></li> </ol>    <ol style="0in" start="10" type="1">  <li style="0in;.0001pt;auto;normal;l0 level1 lfo1"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman", serif; background: white;">Teachers verbally and physically attack      student workers: To coordinate with the factory’s production and      regulation, on July 30, a teacher verbally abused and attacked a student      worker in the factory. That teacher grabbed the intern by the ear, pushed      him and threatened the intern verbally.</span></li> </ol>    <ol style="0in" start="11" type="1">  <li style="0in;.0001pt;auto;normal;l0 level1 lfo1"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman", serif; background: white;">Amazon may have known about the issue regarding      Foxconn’s illegal recruitment of dispatch workers: According to an      internal document, Foxconn mentions they will try to reach an agreement      with Amazon about allowing dispatch workers exceed 10% of the workforce      during peak season. If Amazon knew about this, then Foxconn and Amazon      together, violated the standard regarding the proportion of dispatch      workers. (Picture 2 in report). This violates Article 4 of “Interim      Provisions on Labor Dispatch”, which stipulates that “an employer shall      strictly control the number of dispatched workers employed which shall not      exceed 10% of the total number of its workers.”</span></li> </ol>    <ol style="0in" start="12" type="1">  <li style="0in;.0001pt;auto;normal;l0 level1 lfo1"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman", serif; background: white;">The local government intervened in the      intern program at Hengyang Technical College: According to an internal      document, Foxconn mentions they are hoping Hengyang Technical College will      send 600 students as interns. Hengyang Technical College decided that they      can send 600 students, but the students would only be able to work for two      months (Mid-Sep. to Mid-Nov.). Foxconn would like to ask interns to stay      for one more week and complete their internship at the end of November.      The government negotiated with Hengyang Technical College, to ensure that      students would be able to extend their internship for one additional      week. (Picture 2 in report). This violates Article 9 of “The      Administrative Provisions On the Internships of Vocational School      Students”, which stipulates that “any unit or department should not      interfere with the arrangement and implementation of the student      internship program in vocational schools, and may not force vocational      schools to arrange students to intern at a specific work unit”.   </span></li> </ol>    <ol style="0in" start="13" type="1">  <li style="0in;.0001pt;auto;normal;l0 level1 lfo1"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman", serif; background: white;">Interns have to keep their heads down at the      workstation for an extended period of time and do repetitive motions. The      frequency of their motions is more than 50 times per minute when they are      at workstations. Our investigation found that interns were working at the      same position as regular workers, including overtime and night shifts. The      factory set production goals for interns everyday. These activities      violate Article 3 of the “Provisions of Juvenile Worker Protection”, which      states that “Juvenile workers are not to engage in work positions that      requires them to keep their heads down, backs bent, doings lifts or      squats, etc. for a long period of time. The frequency of their motions      cannot be more than 50 times per minute on the production line”.<br></span></li></ol><div><ol style="0in" start="12" type="1"> </ol> </div><div style="text-align: center; "><img src="http://www.chinalaborwatch.org/upfile/2019_08_07/IWOG0991.JPG" width="350" height="466" alt referrerpolicy="no-referrer">  <img src="http://www.chinalaborwatch.org/upfile/2019_08_07/GJPK8182.JPG" width="350" height="466" alt referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></div><div> </div><div style="text-align: center; ">Left: Workers on break; Right: Factory cafeteria</div><div> </div><div style="text-align: center; "><img src="http://www.chinalaborwatch.org/upfile/2019_08_07/LKAP6789.JPG" alt width="350" height="466" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">  <img src="http://www.chinalaborwatch.org/upfile/2019_08_07/IMG_4299.JPG" width="350" height="466" alt referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></div><div style="text-align: center; "> </div><div style="text-align: center; ">Factory Dormitory </div><ul style="0in" type="disc"> </ul><div>    <br><br><br><br><br> </div>
