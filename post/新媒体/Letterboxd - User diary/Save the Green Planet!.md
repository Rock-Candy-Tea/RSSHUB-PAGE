<p><em>This review may contain spoilers.</em></p>
<div><p>truly hadn't heard of this movie until they announced Ari Aster was producing the American remake, but i'm glad i saw it because i think the premise is terrific and pretty fucking good most of the way through. truth be told though, I do not like the ending! sooni dying the way she did felt... cruel? and the final alien reveal, which would've probably worked much better in 2003, seems like the obvious ending. and i don't begrudge it for being the obvious ending because that's also probably the right move, the thing i don't really get from it is... the point? like, what's the thematic throughline there. maybe it's nothing! maybe it's just supposed to be a funny ending! truth be told as soon as sooni died i felt my enjoyment dip pretty significantly.</p><p>anyway, shin ha-kyun is wild hot? it's obvious in sympathy for mr. vengeance and then when he pops up again here i'm like "okay shit this guy's just handsome in all modes" and then you go to his wikipedia and you're like what the fuck why do you look like that. that's crazy man, why do you look like that. just imagine me sending a link to his wiki to all my boys at 2am and getting several "got damn who's the beefcake" responses immediately</p></div>
