<div><p><i>“Wait!” called Terence Malick. “You didn’t hear the last ingredient! A dearth of style and the sympathetic POV of a morally-accessible character as to not misrepresent any portrayals as glorification!“ But Oliver Stone was already out the door.</i></p><p>Wonderful. So warm and simple it feels like a movie I've known all my life. The tone and ease of a movie a teacher would've shown us in high school with the subject matter of a movie a teacher would've shown us in high school before being fired for something everybody heard rumblings about. Anything interesting I could say about this movie would be ruined if you ever found out I spent every four minutes saying "Badlands" with a Chet Haze-ian patois.</p></div>
