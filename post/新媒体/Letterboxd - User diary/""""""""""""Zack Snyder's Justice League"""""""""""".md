<div><p>look, i didn't finish this movie (we made it to 2:19:48 before bailing) and i'm not going to. so if you're one of those guys who gets mad when people do that, i don't know, take a lap</p><p>i don’t think of zack snyder as a storyteller as much as I think of him as a trailermaker. every shot, every line, every moment, every direction of his films is made to ensure it’s trailer-ready, as if he finds no value in subtlety and wants every frame to feel as godly and divine as his characters. which is probably why i don’t like his superhero movies very much; i don’t want that in a hero. i don’t find godliness interesting. the snyderverse is stories of gods who are destined to protect humanity but snyder doesn’t seem as interested in displaying their humanity as much as he is in displaying their power. and, sure! how lovely for people who enjoy that- but it ain’t me!</p><p>i think power is an interesting concept in the hands of humans who have opted to wield it, desire it, or struggle to wield it responsibly while getting to retain their humanity. the closest thing to that in this universe is batman, but he has absolutely no personality here, he’s just the producer. none of these humans feel like lived-in people, just a series of moments. no one talks like a person, they talk like a plot device. characters are designated as comic relief and written to fill that goal in every moment, regardless of the stakes or tension. i do not care about gods and chosen ones, their power is always a secondary concept to “destiny” or ancient symbolism or whatever, which is BORING. not to mention, i think it looks like shit. sorry! it’s brown and grim and shiny and zack snyder only wants to speed things up or slow them down because that’s the trailermaker “cool shot” mentality.</p><p>anyways, i do love that zack snyder gets to make his weird, grim shit for people who ARE interested in this type of movie. so, don't yell at me! gonna make it real weird when we're both in line for 'army of the dead'</p></div>
