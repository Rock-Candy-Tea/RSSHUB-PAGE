<div><p>This movie kicks ass. I think it's messy and honestly probably a little sexist, but I also think it kicks ass. Bodies and beauty and aging are all simultaneously goofy and horrific and it's fun to see a movie make that so explicit. Really wanted to watch it after (the great!) Todd Vaziri mentioned it as an "older" film whose effects hold up in this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhLWP_l6CBU" rel="nofollow">WIRED Q&A.</a> And they really do! Goldie and Meryl seem like they're having a blast, and Bruce Willis should always have been playing this exact kind of role for the rest of his career. In closing, I wish all Isabella Rosselini a very pleasant shoot me with a gun.</p></div>
