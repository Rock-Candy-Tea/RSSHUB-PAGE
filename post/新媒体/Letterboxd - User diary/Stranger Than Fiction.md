<div><p>I liked this movie a lot when I first saw it as a teenager without any previous experience or understanding of a story able to also be <i>about</i> storytelling, and I like it a lot as an adult who knows the word "meta!" Possibly Ferrell at his finest? Definitely not two-time Academy Award winners Thompson or Hoffman at their finest but I'd make a (really bad, under-informed) argument that it's close! So much of this movie is extremely satisfying, even with Maggie Gyllenhaal's character being so underwritten you have to wonder why a cool socialist baker has any interest in this guy at all.</p><p>Speaking of which– one of the most consistently stupid 'takes' for ages now both online and off has been the suggestion that Maggie Gyllenhaal is ugly or turtle-faced or whatever. It's gross enough that people feel confident enough to declare certain actresses "ugly" without any prompt but, are you kidding me?? <i>Maggie Gyllenhaal??????</i> Shut the fuck up. I will dunk your head in a goddamn toilet. Any woman in the public eye through the 2000s that didn't look like a 12-year old became a punchline and we never once came to terms with the staying power of these "jokes" as a culture. So many names became synonymous with farm animals, and the associations are <i>still</i> regurgitated like muscle memories, without any consideration for how obviously sexist it is. Meanwhile, every single motherfucker who says this looks like a wet hat. Deeply embarrassing.</p><p>The 'flours' thing is genuinely very cute.</p></div>
