            <div class="text  en"><p> </p><p><strong>The U.S. trial is still ongoing</strong></p><p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the federal agency of the Department of Health and Human Services, has its own drug approval process, which is independent of other global agencies.</p><p>It requires data from human clinical trials in the U.S. to determine whether a vaccine is safe and effective, rather than accepting results from trials in other countries, before it can issue an authorization.</p><p>To pass muster, the vaccine will need to prevent disease or decrease the severity of the disease in at least 50 percent of people vaccinated. Moderna, Pfizer-BioNTech and Johnson & Johnson have shown through U.S.-based trials that their vaccines are well above that threshold, and were thus given emergency authorization by the FDA.</p><p>Drug approvals usually take months once an application is filed, but the FDA's emergency authorizations for COVID-19 vaccines have been granted within weeks, mainly thanks to the government's Operation Warp Speed, initiated last year by the then president Donald Trump to accelerate the testing, supply, development and distribution of safe and effective vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics to counter COVID-19.</p><p>AstraZeneca was awarded up to $1.2 billion through the operation. While Operation Warp Speed had previously estimated that AstraZeneca would file for authorization in January 2021, issues involving delays with the vaccine trials due to adverse reactions put this into question.</p><p> </p></div>

Currently, the trial data is being reviewed by independent monitors, a top U.S. official told Reuters last week.</p><p>If the results are positive and all goes well, the FDA would review the data and issue the authorization in about a month's time, Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, said in an interview.</p><p>"We expect data from our U.S. Phase III trial to be available soon, and we plan to file for emergency use authorization shortly thereafter," AstraZeneca spokeswoman Michele Meixell said in a statement last week.<br> </p></div>

            <div class="text  en"><p> </p><p><strong>Confusing initial trial data </strong></p><p>A challenge that faced AstraZeneca in gaining FDA approval was that its initial trial data had been slightly murky and confusing. </p><p>Trial results pooled from differently designed clinical trials in the UK and Brazil – a break from standard practice in reporting the results of drug and vaccine trials – raised questions about dosing as well as how well it works for people over the age of 65.</p><p>Last year, in November, AstraZeneca reported that its shot was 62 percent effective at preventing COVID-19 among nearly 8,900 volunteers in Brazil and the UK. The participants in that trial received two full doses, but around 2,800 others accidentally received a half dose followed by a full dose a month later. Among that smaller group, the vaccine's effectiveness rose to 90 percent – which AstraZeneca then averaged, stating that the vaccine was 70 percent effective. </p><p> </p></div>
