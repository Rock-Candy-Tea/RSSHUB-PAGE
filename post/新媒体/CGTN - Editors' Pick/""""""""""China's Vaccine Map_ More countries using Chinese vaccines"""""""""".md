            <div class="text  en"><p>The fight against the COVID-19 pandemic is the most pressing task facing the world today. Vaccines are the most powerful weapon to win the battle. China attaches great importance to the equitable distribution of vaccines, especially the accessibility and affordability in developing countries. </p><p>Ambassador Zhang Jun, China's permanent representative to the United Nations, sent a letter on March 15 to UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, informing him of China's decision to donate 300,000 doses of COVID-19 vaccines to UN peacekeepers, with priority given to the peacekeeping missions in Africa.</p><p>This is a further step to make China's vaccines a global public good, and also a demonstration of China's firm and continuous support of the UN and multilateralism. </p><p>As of Sunday, China has provided vaccine assistance to dozens of countries and several international organizations. More and more countries and people are benefiting from China's vaccines. A batch of Chinese COVID-19 vaccines departed Beijing for Benin on Saturday, and another batch departed Beijing for Niger on Friday.</p></div>
