            <div class="text  en"><p>As COVID-19 lockdowns begin to ease across Europe, the idea of returning to 'normal' life after over a year of restrictions has caused many to feel anxious. </p><p>"The thought of lockdown lifting is kind of like a ticking time bomb," Amy Clement, from London, told CGTN Europe.</p><p>Georgia Holmes, from Sussex, southern England admitted: "I don't like not knowing what's going to happen and I'm not in control."</p><p>But they are not alone. There are many people across the world with the same thoughts going through their heads.</p><p> </p><p class="paragraph-blue"><strong>READ MORE</strong></p><p class="paragraph-blue"><a href="https://newseu.cgtn.com/news/2021-03-21/Is-Lahti-s-smartphone-app-the-key-to-halting-climate-change--YNfHOOYlb2/index.html">The app aiming to tackle climate change</a></p><p class="paragraph-blue"><a href="https://newseu.cgtn.com/news/2021-03-21/EU-chief-Von-der-Leyen-threatens-to-halt-exports-of-AstraZeneca-jab-YNnxMdByOQ/index.html">EU chief threatens vaccine export ban</a></p><p class="paragraph-blue"><a href="https://newseu.cgtn.com/news/2021-03-20/Volcano-dormant-for-800-years-erupts-near-Iceland-s-capital--YMZSCZvXy0/index.html">Iceland volcano erupts - after 800 years</a></p><p> </p></div>
            <div class="text  en"><p><strong>'Absolutely terrified'</strong></p><p>Most UK lockdown restrictions are expected to be lifted by June 21, putting time pressure on those worrying about what the future holds. </p><p>Clement, whose job as a theater stage manager was put on hold amid the pandemic, has spent her time learning new skills during lockdown, including Spanish and playing the guitar. She is struggling to come to terms with the thought of lockdown ending. </p><p>"I'm sort of half relieved and pleased and half absolutely terrified," she said. "It's kind of brought out a lot of anxiety in me: I've got pressure now. </p><p>"There's a time pressure: I need to be OK for that time. I need to be ready to go and socialize, I need to be ready to work, I need to be ready to go to a bar with my friends or go out to a nightclub."</p><p> </p></div>

            <div class="text  en"><p> </p><p>"And I think the time aspect of it, the minute you put pressure on yourself to feel better by certain time is when it gets even harder because you're putting extra pressure on yourself to deal with something that you're already struggling to deal with," she added.</p><p>The impending date has also worried Holmes, who has enjoyed spending time going on walks with her boyfriend during the lockdown.</p><p>"I think as of June 21, I think the world's going to go crazy, and that really worries me," she said. "And it makes me feel so anxious that in June we're all going to be expected just to be normal again. And I don't know how we're meant to act normally again, because it has only been a year, but a year is a long time," she said.</p><p> </p></div>
            <div class="text  en"><p><strong>What can people do to help themselves?</strong></p><p>These stories are typical of increased anxiety. There has been an increase of people scared about the end of lockdown, according to Dave Smithson, the operations director at charity Anxiety UK. </p><p>He urged people to try to get themselves back into some sort of a routine so that they feel more prepared when restrictions are eased.</p><p>"Try to get engaged in something that's going to help you manage that [anxiety]," Smithson advised. "One of the ways of treating anxieties is graded exposure, where you slowly increase your level of exposure to that fear.</p><p>"So if you're not having to go back to work for the next three, four or five weeks, maybe now's a good time to start getting used to getting back into your routine. Try to get up in the morning normally as if you were going to go to work, get ready for work and think about what you would be doing if you were at work."</p><p>Smithson also gave advice for anyone still struggling when lockdown finally ends, urging people not to rush back into 'normal' life if they don't feel ready to.</p><p>"Don't feel pressurized to rush back at it," he said. "Don't think that you've got to go out the first weekend and party all night long. Some people will want to – fair enough, if they're comfortable – but those who are anxious should take it one step at a time. Ease yourself back into normal life as much as you can."</p><p> </p><p><strong>Video editing: Steve Chappell</strong></p></div>
