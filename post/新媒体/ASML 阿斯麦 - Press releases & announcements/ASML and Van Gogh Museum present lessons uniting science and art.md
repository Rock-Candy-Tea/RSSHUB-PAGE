<p>On November 10, 2020, World Science Day, ASML and the Van Gogh Museum present ‘Masterminds & Masterpieces’, a program of lessons uniting science and art.</p> <br> <p>Vincent van Gogh’s investigative and exploratory mind underpinned his artistic skill. To help stimulate this investigative attitude in schoolchildren, the new lessons will challenge them to follow in Van Gogh’s footsteps by experimenting with color and light. The lessons are offered for free on the Van Gogh Museum’s teaching platform, and ASML is also offering packages with the necessary teaching materials to a hundred schools in the Amsterdam region.</p>
