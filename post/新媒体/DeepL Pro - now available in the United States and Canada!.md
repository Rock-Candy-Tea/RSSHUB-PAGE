<p>     We are delighted to announce that DeepL Pro is now available in the Land of the Free and the True North! This has been a longstanding goal of ours and we are very proud to welcome our American and Canadian friends.     </p>     <p>     All DeepL Pro subscription plans, providing added data protection, unlimited translation capacity, API access, and more, are available immediately. Additionally, we are very happy to allow our North-America-based clients to pay for their DeepL Pro subscriptions in their local currencies, US and Canadian dollars.     </p>     <p>     We’re constantly working to enter new markets and will be making DeepL Pro available in further countries in the near future.     </p>     <p>     Please note that while businesses in Quebec may sign up as of today, registration will be open for private citizens shortly.     </p>
