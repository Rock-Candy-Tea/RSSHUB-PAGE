<p><em>Month-to-month sales tick up 1.0% worldwide during first month of 2021</em></p>
<p>WASHINGTON—March 1, 2021—The Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) today announced global semiconductor industry sales were $40.0 billion for the month of January 2021, an increase of 13.2% over the January 2020 total of $35.3 billion and 1.0% more than the December 2020 total of $39.6 billion. Monthly sales are compiled by the <a href="https://www.wsts.org/">World Semiconductor Trade Statistics (WSTS) organization</a> and represent a three-month moving average. SIA represents 98% of the U.S. semiconductor industry by revenue and nearly two-thirds of non-U.S. chip firms.</p>

<p>Regionally, year-to-year sales increased across all markets: Asia Pacific/All Other (16.0%), the Americas (15.4%), China (12.4%), Japan (9.6%), and Europe (6.4%). Month-to-month sales increased in China (3.4%), Europe (2.0% percent), and Asia Pacific/All Other (1.5%), but were down in Japan (-1.0%) and the Americas (-3.0%).</p>
