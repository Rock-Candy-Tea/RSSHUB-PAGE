            Windows 10's search function allows you to find pretty much anything you want on your computer. This feature is now getting a deeper Microsoft Edge integration, which means you'll now be able to pull content from this browser in your future searches.

            As spotted in Microsoft Edge's Canary channel, you'll now have an option in this browser to share your browsing data with Windows Search. Once you enable this option, you'll be able to find Edge's content right in the familiar Windows search box.

            When turned on, Microsoft Edge will connect local browsing data from this profile with the rest of Windows. Turning this feature on will help you find information from your history, favorites, top sites and recent tabs more easily using features such as Windows search box. If you turn off this feature Microsoft Edge will remove the data shared with Windows on the device and stop sharing any new browsing data from this profile.

                        <p>
            You'll also be able to search for tabs that were recently open in Microsoft Edge. This helps you quickly get to the sites that you've just closed in your browser.

            In order to search Edge's content using Windows Search, you need to enable an option in your browser. Currently, the option is only available in the Canary channel and it's yet to roll out to stable releases.

            When the feature arrives for you, you'll need to head into your profile settings and enable <strong>Share browsing data with other Windows features</strong>. This will turn the feature on.

            You'll no longer have to open Edge to search your tabs and browsing history; you'll be able to do this right from Windows Search. If you're concerned about your privacy, you can disable this feature anytime you want.
