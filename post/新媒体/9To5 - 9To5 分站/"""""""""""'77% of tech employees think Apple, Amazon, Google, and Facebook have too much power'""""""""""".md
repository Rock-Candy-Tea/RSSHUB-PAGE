<p>A survey of 1,500 tech employees found that 77% of them think that Apple, Amazon, Google, and Facebook have too much power. Only 8% disagreed.</p>
<p>Tech workers were also asked about a wide range of other tech issues, including working with law enforcement, China, and legislating AI… </p>

</p>
<p>The survey was carried out by <em><a href="https://www.protocol.com/policy/tech-employee-survey/tech-employee-survey-2021" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Protocol</a>,</em> from the publisher of <em>Politico.</em></p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>To take a pulse of where tech employees across the country stand on key issues facing the industry, Protocol is introducing its first Tech Employee Survey, a survey of 1,504 employees nationwide, from C-suite level executives to associates. They hail mostly from large tech companies — almost 40% of respondents work at companies with annual revenue over $500 million and most of the companies have more than 1,000 employees.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The first topic was whether tech giants are too powerful.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>A whopping 78% of the tech employees we surveyed agreed that the tech industry is too powerful, with just 11% disagreeing. The same goes for Facebook, Amazon, Alphabet, and Apple. Over 77% of respondents said those companies have too much power, and just over 8% disagreed.</p>
<p>Not only did the majority say that the industry is too powerful, but around 40% also said that tech does more harm than good. Only about 45% of tech employees disagreed, signaling that even within the industry, tech workers worry about the negative impact technology is having on the world.</p>
<p>And yet, remedies are in short supply. More than 68% want their companies to partner with or be acquired by a Big Tech player, and three quarters said Big Tech companies should be allowed to acquire other firms. Just over 40% think that Facebook, Amazon, Alphabet and Apple should be broken up. Despite their concerns about tech’s power and negative influence, tech employees don’t see <a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/antitrust/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">antitrust</a> enforcement as the solution.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On China, a majority think the US government has been too aggressive, worrying that an equally robust response from China could cripple US tech companies.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The Trump administration adopted a hawkish stance toward China’s tech industry, placing dozens of companies on the country’s trade blacklist and signing multiple executive orders aimed at barring Chinese social media apps — most notably TikTok — from the US. Tech employees by and large said they think the standoff should end, expressing an openness toward working more closely with Chinese tech firms.</p>
<p>Fifty-six percent of respondents said they agree that US restrictions on Chinese technology companies have gone too far, while 28% said they’re neutral on it. And 60% agreed that U.S. tech companies should work more closely with Chinese tech companies. Ultimately, a majority of respondents said they believe the future of the tech industry is at stake, with 58% agreeing that a cold war with China could “cripple U.S. tech companies.”</p>
<p>There are limits to their openness to Chinese tech, however — 46% said they agree Chinese telecom company Huawei should be banned from the US.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There’s concern about AI, especially when it comes to demonstrated issues of AI systems picking up, and amplifying, biases present in society.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>AI can supercharge real-world biases and disproportionately harm people of color. Seventy-three percent of respondents said they agree that the government should regulate AI. Only 9% disagreed, and 18% said they are “neutral.” </p>
