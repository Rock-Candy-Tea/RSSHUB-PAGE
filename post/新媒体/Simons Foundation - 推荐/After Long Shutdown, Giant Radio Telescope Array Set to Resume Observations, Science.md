<p></p><p>The Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), a set of 66 radio astronomy dishes perched high in the Chilean Andes, shut down on last March and has remained silent ever since. But ALMA managers announced that observations will resume this month, after a 6-month campaign of repairs and planning.</p>
