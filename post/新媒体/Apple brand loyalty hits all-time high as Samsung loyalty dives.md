<p>Apple brand loyalty among smartphone owners has hit an all-time high, according to a survey by SellCell. It shows that 91.9% of <a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/iphone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">iPhone</a> owners plan to buy another iPhone when they next upgrade, up 1.4% from 2019.</p>
<p><a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/samsung/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Samsung</a>, in contrast, has seen its own brand loyalty plunge … </p>

<p><a href="https://www.sellcell.com/blog/cell-phone-brand-loyalty-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SellCell says</a> that only 74% of Samsung smartphone owners plan to buy another Samsung model, down from 85.7% in 2019.</p>
<p>iPhone owners gave four reasons for sticking with Apple:</p>
<ul>
<li>Like iPhone best or never had an issue with it: 65%</li>
<li>Locked into the ecosystem: 21%</li>
<li>Switching from iOS to Android is too much hassle: 10%</li>
<li>Prefer to stick to what they know: 8%</li>
</ul>
<p>The ecosystem is clearly a big advantage for Apple. While almost as many Samsung owners were happy with the brand as Apple owners (64% versus 65%), just 5% said they were too invested in the Samsung world.</p>
<p>iPhone owners who plan to switch to Android gave three main reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Other brand has better technology (e.g., screen, camera, battery, etc.): 38%</li>
<li>Prefer the design of other brand: 26.4%</li>
<li>Latest model from the other brand has more features than the latest model of my current brand: 12.9%</li>
</ul>
<p>Almost half would switch to Samsung, and a third to a Google Pixel.</p>
<p>Conversely, the majority of Samsung owners would switch to iPhone, almost a third of them saying that Apple offers better privacy protection, and a quarter saying they consider Apple offers better value for money.</p>
<p>SellCell also asked respondents to pick their favorite smartphone, with the <a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/iphone-12/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">iPhone 12</a> and and 12 Pro Max heading the list.</p>
<ol>
<li>Apple iPhone 12 — 17%</li>
<li>Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max — 12.7%</li>
<li>Samsung Galaxy S21 — 11.4%</li>
<li>Apple iPhone 12 Pro — 10.6%</li>
<li>Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra — 10%</li>
<li>Samsung Galaxy S21+ — 9%</li>
<li>Google Pixel 5 — 8.1%</li>
<li>Apple iPhone 12 Mini — 6.3%</li>
<li>Other — 5%</li>
<li>Samsung Galaxy Z Fold2 5G — 3.1%</li>
</ol>
<p>The survey sample is 5,000 US smartphone owners – 2,000 each of iPhone and Samsung, and the rest split across other brands roughly in line with market share. </p>
