<p>As a jailbreaker, I appreciate just how easy AltServer and <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/tag/altstore">AltStore</a> make the process of side-loading <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/2019/11/21/types-of-jailbreaks/">semi-untethered</a> jailbreak apps like <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/tag/odyssey">Odyssey</a> and <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/tag/unc0ver">unc0ver</a> to my iPhones and iPads. On the other hand, it can be burdensome to keep track of how many more days those apps will work before they need to be signed again.</p>
<p>The AltStore app provides a handy native-style widget for iOS & iPadOS 14 devices that can help you keep track, but if you prefer something more conspicuous, then we think there’s a high likelihood that you’ll appreciate a newly released and free <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/tag/jailbreak-apps-tweaks">jailbreak tweak</a> called <strong>IconCert 14</strong> by iOS developer <em>Hao Nguyen (haoict)</em>.</p>

<p><span id="more-858347"></span></p>
<p>Just as the tweak’s name implies, IconCert 14 adds a badge to the side-loaded app icon in question that depicts how long it’ll remain signed for. The screenshot examples below depict what this looks like:</p>

<p>It’s worth noting that the concept behind IconCert 14 is far from new. The tweak was originally launched as just <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/2017/05/18/iconcert/">IconCert</a> by iOS developer faz almost three years ago when the iOS 10-based Yalu jailbreak was ubiquitous. Nguyen recognized that the tweak’s functionality would still be relevant in today’s jailbreak community, and consequently, re-created the tweak for modern jailbreaks for iOS & iPadOS.</p>
<p>Once installed, IconCert 14 adds a dedicated preference pane to the Settings app where users can configure the tweak to their liking:</p>

<p>Options here include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Toggle IconCert 14 on or off on demand</li>
<li>Enable or disable animations</li>
<li>Choose the preferred time format for the badge:
<ul>
<li>DD HH (example: 6d 23h)</li>
<li>DD (example: 6.5d)</li>
<li>HH (example: 144h)</li>
<li>SS (example: 50000s)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Adjust the opacity level of the IconCert 14 badge via a slider</li>
<li>Enter the app identifier keywords to apply the badge to, separated by a comma (AltStore and unc0ver added by default)</li>
<li>Reset all settings to their defaults</li>
</ul>
<p>The developer provides an Apply button at the top-right of the preference pane that you can use to save any changes you make on demand.</p>
<p>Anyone who uses a side-loadable jailbreak tool and uses AltStore to keep it signed should consider the new IconCert 14 tweak on their pwned handset, especially if they don’t necessarily prefer the AltStore widget on iOS & iPadOS 14. Despite having “14” in the name, the tweak appears to support <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/jailbreak">jailbroken</a> iOS & iPadOS 13 and 14 devices.</p>
<p>IconCert 14 is <a href="https://haoict.github.io/cydia/">available for free on Nguyen’s personal repository</a> via any package manager you might be using. It will also soon be open source <a href="https://github.com/haoict?tab=repositories">on the developer’s GitHub page</a>. If you aren’t already using Nguyen’s repository, then you can add it to your package manager of choice with the following URL:</p>
