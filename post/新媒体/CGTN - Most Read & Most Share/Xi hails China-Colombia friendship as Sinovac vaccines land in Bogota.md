            <div class="text  en"><p>The vast Pacific Ocean cannot obstruct the profound friendship between China and Colombia, Chinese President Xi Jinping said, as the <a href="https://news.cgtn.com/news/2021-03-21/Colombia-receives-new-batch-of-Chinese-vaccines-YOeVnlowmY/index.html">third batch of Chinese COVID-19 vaccines arrived</a> in the Latin American country on Saturday. <br><br>Xi delivered a speech via video link to the Colombian people at the invitation of President Ivan Duque. <br><br>China-Colombia relations have achieved historic development since establishing diplomatic ties 41 years ago, Xi said, noting that China has become Colombia's second-largest trading partner. <br><br>He hailed the solidarity and cooperation between the two countries in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. The Chinese vaccines arriving in Bogota will facilitate Colombia's National Vaccination Plan, he said. <br><br>In early February, Colombia's National Food and Drug Surveillance Institute approved the emergency use of COVID-19 vaccines developed by Chinese pharmaceutical company Sinovac. Three batches of Sinovac vaccines purchased by Colombia have been delivered during the past month.</p></div>

            <div class="text  en"><p>Xi expressed his hope that the governments and peoples of the two countries will make joint efforts to enhance cooperation in fighting COVID-19 and other areas. <br><br>Duque held a special ceremony to broadcast Xi's speech and thanked China for its support to Colombia in the fight against COVID-19. <br><br>"From Colombia, we say thank you (to the Chinese people), because at this juncture, this diplomatic relationship ... is becoming stronger after four decades of bilateral relations," the Colombian president said in the northern city of Barranquilla. <br><br>There is an extensive consensus across the political spectrum in Colombia to develop relations with China, he said, adding that Colombia is willing to work together with China to deepen their ties. <br><br>The Colombian Ministry of Health and Social Protection has sent Sinovac vaccines to remote regions, especially the Amazon region, and the vaccines are expected to be rolled out next week in places such as prisons and nursing homes. <br>  <br>Colombia had registered 2,331,187 confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection and 61,907 deaths from the disease as of Saturday, according to the ministry.</p></div>
