We should provide positive incentives for economic entities and restrain the breeding and accumulation of financial risks." </p><p>There is still ample room to maneuver the monetary policy, which needs to create a suitable environment for deepening financial reform and opening up, he noted.</p><p>Yi said China's monetary policy should focus on targeted support for key areas and weak links in the economy. </p><p>Policymakers have pledged to support job-creating small firms that have been hit harder by the coronavirus pandemic. </p><p>China's broad money supply growth of about 10 percent at present basically matches nominal economic growth, Yi said. </p><p>"China's monetary policy is in a normal range and has room to provide liquidity and appropriate interest rate levels," Yi said.</p><p>(With input from Reuters)</p></div>
