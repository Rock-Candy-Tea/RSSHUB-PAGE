<p>New in iOS 14 are colorful <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/tag/status-bar">Status Bar</a>-based dot indicators that alert you to when your handset’s camera or microphone <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/2020/06/24/ios-14-status-bar-orange-light-microphone-privacy/">are being used</a> – a commendable feature with respect to <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/tag/privacy">privacy</a>.</p>
<p>By default, the <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/tag/camera">camera</a> indicator dot appears green, while the microphone indicator dot appears a light orange. Unfortunately, there’s no way to change these colors on a stock device.</p>

<p><span id="more-858362"></span></p>
<p>If you’re jailbroken, however, then you aren’t bound by the same rules. A newly released and free <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/tag/jailbreak-apps-tweaks">jailbreak tweak</a> dubbed <strong>IndiColor</strong> by iOS developer <em>smokin1337</em> permits the end user to select custom colors for their Status Bar’s camera and microphone indicator dots on pwned iOS 14 devices.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-858355" src="https://cdn-0.idownloadblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/IndiColor.jpg" alt width="375" height="174" srcset="https://cdn-0.idownloadblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/IndiColor.jpg 641w, https://cdn-0.idownloadblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/IndiColor-255x119.jpg 255w" sizes="(max-width: 375px) 100vw, 375px" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>At the top, a light orange dot reveals that the microphone is being used. The bottom example displays a green dot to indicate camera usage.</em></p>
<p>After you install IndiColor, you’ll find a new preference pane in the Settings app where you can set configurations to your liking:</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-858354" src="https://cdn-0.idownloadblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/IndiColor-Prefs.jpg" alt width="375" height="392" srcset="https://cdn-0.idownloadblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/IndiColor-Prefs.jpg 1284w, https://cdn-0.idownloadblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/IndiColor-Prefs-206x215.jpg 206w, https://cdn-0.idownloadblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/IndiColor-Prefs-768x803.jpg 768w, https://cdn-0.idownloadblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/IndiColor-Prefs-478x500.jpg 478w" sizes="(max-width: 375px) 100vw, 375px" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></p>
<p>You will be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Disable all Status Bar-based dot indicators system-wide</li>
<li>Disable Status Bar-based dot indicators on a per-app basis</li>
<li>Select a custom color for the Status Bar’s microphone indicator dot</li>
<li>Select a custom color for the Status Bar’s camera indicator dot</li>
</ul>
<p>A respring is only required for certain settings, such as disabling the dot indicators system-wide.</p>
<p>As you might come to expect, these Status Bar-based indicator dots are only available for iOS 14 devices, and as such, the tweak is only intended for <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/jailbreak">jailbroken</a> devices running iOS 14 (sorry iOS 13 users…).</p>
<p>If you’d like to go hands-on with the tweak for yourself, then it’s <a href="https://repo.packix.com/package/com.smokin1337.indicolor">available for free from the Packix repository</a>, and can be downloaded from whichever package manager you prefer to use.</p>
