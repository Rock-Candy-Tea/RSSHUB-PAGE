<p>     Since we added Japanese to DeepL Translator, we’ve been amazed by how quickly people in Japan have taken to using our services. We made it a priority to make our paid subscription service, DeepL Pro, available in Japan and we can now announce that that has become a reality.     </p>     <p>     All <a href="https://www.deepl.com/pro">DeepL Pro subscription plans</a>, providing added data protection, unlimited translation capacity, API access, and more, are now available in Japan. Japanese customers also benefit from prices in Yen.     </p>     <p>     We continue to expand DeepL Pro coverage around the world and will add further countries and currencies in the near future.     </p>
