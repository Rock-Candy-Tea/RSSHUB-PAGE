<p><strong>Espoo, Finland – </strong><strong>Nokia today announced the appointment of Nishant Batra, a proven technology leader with broad global experience, as Chief Strategy and Technology Officer and member of the Group Leadership team, effective from January 18, 2021.</strong></p>

<p>"I’m honored to be part of Nokia. This isn’t just about joining a company that has a fantastic portfolio, it’s also about the pride of being associated with such an iconic brand,” says Nishant Batra. “The telecommunications industry is an exciting place to be at the moment with 5G now really taking off, and Nokia is right at the heart of it. The company has the true potential to work with diverse customer groups in the market and I see that we can make a significant impact over the long term. My personal ambition will be to ensure that Nokia is strategically positioned to win and that Nokia Bell Labs continues to be seen as the pinnacle of innovation.”</p>
