<div>   
It was found that PostgreSQL versions before 12.4, before 11.9 and before 10.14 did not properly sanitize the search_path during logical replication. An authenticated attacker could use this flaw in an attack similar to CVE-2018-1058, in order to execute arbitrary SQL command in the context of the user used for replication.
