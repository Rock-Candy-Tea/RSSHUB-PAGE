<b> Explanation: </b> 
No one knew that 2,000 years ago, the technology existed to build such a device. 

The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antikythera_mechanism">Antikythera mechanism</a>, pictured, is now widely regarded as the 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer#Pre-20th_century">first</a> <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/decoding-antikythera-mechanism-first-computer-180953979/">computer</a>.

Found at the bottom of the sea aboard a decaying 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece">Greek</a> ship, 
its complexity prompted decades of study, 
and even today some of its functions likely 
<a href="http://img.gawkerassets.com/img/183lbg3rnl5w2jpg/original.jpg">remain unknown</a>. 

<a href="https://science.nasa.gov/ems/11_xrays">X-ray</a> images of the device, 
however, have confirmed that a main function of its numerous clock-like 
<a href="https://youtu.be/RLPVCJjTNgk">wheels and gears</a> 
is to create a portable, hand-cranked, Earth-centered, 
<a href="https://youtu.be/tmNuG15cqNw?t=410">orrery of the sky</a>, 
predicting future star and planet locations as well as 
<a href="https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap190120.html">lunar</a> and 
<a href="https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap170912.html">solar eclipse</a>s. 

The corroded core of the 
<a href="http://www.antikythera-mechanism.gr/">Antikythera mechanism</a>'s 
largest gear is featured, spanning about 13 centimeters, while the 
<a href="https://youtu.be/UpLcnAIpVRA">entire mechanism</a> 
was 33 centimeters high, making it similar in size to a large book.

Recently, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-84310-w">modern computer modeling</a> of missing components 
is allowing for the creation of a more complete replica of this 
<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-56377567">surprising ancient machine</a>.
