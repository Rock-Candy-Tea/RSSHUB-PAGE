Tariffs were suspended on some spirits, but the 25% tariffs slapped on American whiskey by the EU and UK remain in place. And the EU’s tariff rate is set to double to 50% in June in the key export market for U.S. whiskey makers.</p> </div></div>  <div data-type="text" class="crd clln--it"> <div class=" crd--cnt "> <p class> A leading spirits advocate is imploring top U.S. trade envoy Katherine Tai to not leave whiskey producers behind.

American whiskey exports to the UK, the industry’s fourth-largest market, have fallen by 53% since 2018, it said.</p> </div></div>   <div data-type="image" class="crd card-captioned clln--it"> <div class=" crd--cnt "> <figure class="cls-height" data-trk-photo-credit="Paul Sakuma"> <div class="full-width img-container aspect-ratio-no-aspect"> <img class="b-lazy full-width1" alt="Bourbon, Tennessee whiskey and rye whiskey were left out of a recent breakthrough to start rebuilding trade relations between the U.S. and European Union in the wake of Donald Trump's presidency." data-src="https://www.chicagotribune.com/resizer/L-0r_lDUASCC8Umi4dpxhaoSxvw=/1400x0/top/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/tronc/ZKAOPIXLKLVBEYO2TUFMYCH3CM.aspx" data-src-small="https://www.chicagotribune.com/resizer/gYHPAoGqisf83jSFxIc41fakEx4=/415x237/top/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/tronc/ZKAOPIXLKLVBEYO2TUFMYCH3CM.aspx" data-src-medium="https://www.chicagotribune.com/resizer/nN-H9j-6n9_lscBzD73q-8YDtyk=/800x457/top/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/tronc/ZKAOPIXLKLVBEYO2TUFMYCH3CM.aspx" data-src-mobile="https://www.chicagotribune.com/resizer/gYHPAoGqisf83jSFxIc41fakEx4=/415x237/top/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/tronc/ZKAOPIXLKLVBEYO2TUFMYCH3CM.aspx" src="https://www.chicagotribune.com/resizer/L-0r_lDUASCC8Umi4dpxhaoSxvw=/1400x0/top/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/tronc/ZKAOPIXLKLVBEYO2TUFMYCH3CM.aspx" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"> </div> <figcaption class="caption-text spaced spaced-top spaced-sm flex-container-row justify-space-between "> <div class="cptn"> Bourbon, Tennessee whiskey and rye whiskey were left out of a recent breakthrough to start rebuilding trade relations between the U.S. and European Union in the wake of Donald Trump's presidency. <span class="credit--ctn">(Paul Sakuma)</span></div> </figcaption> </figure> <style>img.full-width1&#123;flex-shrink:0;object-fit:contain;min-height:50%;height:auto;width:100%&#125;</style></div></div> <div data-type="text" class="crd clln--it"> <div class=" crd--cnt "> <p class> The tariffs amount to a tax, which whiskey producers can either absorb in reduced profits or pass along to customers through higher prices — and risk losing market share in highly competitive markets.</p> </div></div> <div data-type="text" class="crd clln--it"> <div class=" crd--cnt "> <p class> Amir Peay, owner of the Lexington, Kentucky-based James E. Pepper Distillery, said American whiskey has become “collateral damage” in the trade disputes. It’s cost him about three-fourths of his European business, and the looming 50% EU tariff threatens to drain what’s left.</p> </div></div>  <div data-type="text" class="crd clln--it"> <div class=" crd--cnt "> <p class> “That could possibly end our business in Europe as we’ve known it over the years,” Peay said in a phone interview Thursday.</p> </div></div> <div data-type="text" class="crd clln--it"> <div class=" crd--cnt "> <p class> He’s already curtailed some whiskey shipments to Europe as a hedge against the potential doubling of the EU tariff.

The tariff suspensions applied to duties that had been imposed on some spirits producers on both sides of the Atlantic. But the breakthroughs left plenty unresolved, including disputes that led to the retaliatory tariffs still hitting American whiskey.</p> </div></div> <div data-type="text" class="crd clln--it"> <div class=" crd--cnt "> <p class> The suspended tariffs mean some European spirits producers can ship their products into the U.S. duty free, while American whiskey makers are still subject to tariffs, Whiting said.</p> </div></div> <div data-type="text" class="crd clln--it"> <div class=" crd--cnt "> <p class data-item-type="depthscroll" data-item-id="depth_scroll_bottom" data-item-number="bottom"> “We just want a level playing field for American whiskey,” he said.</p> <div class="spaced spaced-md spaced-bottom hddn-mble"></div> <div class="spaced spaced-sm spaced-bottom hddn-dktp hddn-tbl"></div> </div></div> </div>  </div> <div id="f0b6YJJV5Q0Xps" class="pb-async pb-feature"></div> <div id="fQNMYA1V5Q0Xps" class="pb-async pb-feature"></div>  <div class="pb-container"> </div>
