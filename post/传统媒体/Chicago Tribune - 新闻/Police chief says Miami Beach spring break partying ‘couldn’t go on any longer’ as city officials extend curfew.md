They said it’s not college students, but adults looking to let loose in one of the few states fully open during the pandemic.</p> </div></div>  <div data-type="text" class="crd clln--it"> <div class=" crd--cnt "> <p class> Law enforcement officers from at least four other agencies, along with SWAT teams, were added to help contain the raucous crowds, but it wasn’t enough. After days of partying, including several confrontations with police, Miami Beach officials enacted a highly unorthodox curfew Saturday from 8 p.m. until 6 a.m., forcing restaurants to stop outdoor seating entirely during the three-day emergency period, and encouraging local businesses to voluntarily shut down.</p> </div></div> <div data-type="text" class="crd clln--it"> <div class=" crd--cnt "> <p class> More than half of the more than 1,000 arrests were from out of state, said City Manager Raul Aguila, adding many are coming “to engage in lawlessness and an anything goes party attitude.” He also noted that the crowds weren’t eating at restaurants or patronizing businesses generating badly needed tourism dollars, but merely congregating by the thousands in the street.</p> </div></div>   <div data-type="text" class="crd clln--it"> <div class=" crd--cnt "> <p class> Officers in bulletproof vests dispersed pepper spray balls Saturday night into a defiant, but mostly nonviolent crowd, refusing to submit to the curfew that had only been enacted four hours earlier. Some people responded by jumping on top of cars, twerking and throwing money into the air.</p> </div></div> <div data-type="text" class="crd clln--it"> <div class=" crd--cnt "> <p class> A military style vehicle was seen rolling down the palm-tree lined Ocean Drive as outnumbered Miami Beach police officers struggled to disperse the raucous crowds Saturday. Tourists were urged to stay inside their hotels and pedestrians or vehicles were not allowed to enter the restricted area after 8 p.m.</p> </div></div>   <div data-type="text" class="crd clln--it"> <div class=" crd--cnt "> <p class> Miami Beach police Chief Richard Clements initially became concerned Monday when the crowds seemed larger than normal on what is typically a quieter day. A group of vehicles blocked the street “and basically had an impromptu street party,” he said. By Thursday, the crowds were growing, fights were breaking out, setting off dangerous stampedes of people fleeing for safety.</p> </div></div> <div data-type="text" class="crd clln--it"> <div class=" crd--cnt "> <p class> “We couldn’t go on any longer,” Clements said during Sunday’s meeting, defending the city’s curfew. “I think this was the right decision.”</p> </div></div>  <div data-type="text" class="crd clln--it"> <div class=" crd--cnt "> <p class> By Friday night, police said the partying was out of control. One restaurant was “turned upside down” in the melee, “chairs were used as weapons,” and broken glass covered the floor.</p> </div></div> <div data-type="image" class="crd card-captioned clln--it"> <div class=" crd--cnt "> <figure class="cls-height" data-trk-photo-credit="Joe Raedle"> <div class="full-width img-container aspect-ratio-no-aspect"> <img class="b-lazy full-width1" alt="People enjoy themselves along Ocean Drive on March 19, 2021, in Miami Beach, Florida.
