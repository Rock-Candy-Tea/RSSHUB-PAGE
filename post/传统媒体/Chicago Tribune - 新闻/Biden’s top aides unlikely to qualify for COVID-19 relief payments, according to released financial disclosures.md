The disclosure period runs through 2020.</p> </div></div>  <div data-type="text" class="crd clln--it"> <div class=" crd--cnt "> <p class> The documents paint a portrait of advisers whose wealth is dwarfed by those that surrounded President Donald Trump but do not quite line up with Biden’s image of “Middle Class Joe.”</p> </div></div> <div data-type="text" class="crd clln--it"> <div class=" crd--cnt "> <p class> Some of Biden’s top advisers worked for President Barack Obama’s administration and moved into the corporate world before returning to government service. Others in the West Wing — whose positions don’t require Senate confirmation — have had deep ties to the business world.</p> </div></div>   <div data-type="text" class="crd clln--it"> <div class=" crd--cnt "> <p class> White House chief of staff Ron Klain, who worked for Biden when he was vice president, had been an executive at the venture capital firm Revolution. He was listed as having a salary of $1.8 million, according to his disclosure form. The threshold for direct payments is $80,000 for individuals and $160,000 for couples.</p> </div></div> <div data-type="image" class="crd card-captioned clln--it"> <div class=" crd--cnt "> <figure class="cls-height" data-trk-photo-credit="Patrick Semansky"> <div class="full-width img-container aspect-ratio-no-aspect"> <img class="b-lazy full-width1" alt="President Joe Biden visits a COVID-19 vaccination site at the VA Medical Center in Washington, Monday, March 8, 2021." data-src="https://www.chicagotribune.com/resizer/6ihlKCjL4oVEOtdPIKeU8ryM7cY=/1400x0/top/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/tronc/X3IO52AXVQQV32A4DT6XNV4B2I.aspx" data-src-small="https://www.chicagotribune.com/resizer/jYqgUpZksQekfOOtwPVcIFDH_3k=/415x276/top/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/tronc/X3IO52AXVQQV32A4DT6XNV4B2I.aspx" data-src-medium="https://www.chicagotribune.com/resizer/7rpZLs61onKmvi7jIPQ4TcnQfHM=/800x533/top/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/tronc/X3IO52AXVQQV32A4DT6XNV4B2I.aspx" data-src-mobile="https://www.chicagotribune.com/resizer/jYqgUpZksQekfOOtwPVcIFDH_3k=/415x276/top/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/tronc/X3IO52AXVQQV32A4DT6XNV4B2I.aspx" src="https://www.chicagotribune.com/resizer/6ihlKCjL4oVEOtdPIKeU8ryM7cY=/1400x0/top/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/tronc/X3IO52AXVQQV32A4DT6XNV4B2I.aspx" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"> </div> <figcaption class="caption-text spaced spaced-top spaced-sm flex-container-row justify-space-between "> <div class="cptn"> President Joe Biden visits a COVID-19 vaccination site at the VA Medical Center in Washington, Monday, March 8, 2021. <span class="credit--ctn">(Patrick Semansky)</span></div> </figcaption> </figure> <style>img.full-width1&#123;flex-shrink:0;object-fit:contain;min-height:50%;height:auto;width:100%&#125;</style></div></div> <div data-type="text" class="crd clln--it"> <div class=" crd--cnt "> <p class> Jen O’Malley Dillon, who ran Biden’s campaign before becoming his deputy chief of staff, was a co-founder of the consulting firm Precision Strategies and her financial disclosure gives a glimpse into the corporate advisory work she did for the firm. The filing lists clients such as General Electric, Lyft and Gates Ventures, the venture capital firm founded by billionaire Bill Gates. </p> </div></div>   <div data-type="text" class="crd clln--it"> <div class=" crd--cnt "> <p class data-item-type="depthscroll" data-item-id="depth_scroll_middle" data-item-number="middle"> O’Malley Dillon’s deferred compensation and severance from Precision is listed as being over $420,000.</p> </div></div> <div data-type="text" class="crd clln--it"> <div class=" crd--cnt "> <p class> White House coronavirus response coordinator Jeffrey Zients was the CEO of the Wall Street investment firm Cranemere and his financial disclosure shows that he had a combined salary and bonus of $1.6 million. As a board member of Facebook, he made over $330,000, the new report shows.</p> </div></div>  <div data-type="text" class="crd clln--it"> <div class=" crd--cnt "> <p class> Biden, long considered the poorest member of the Senate, fashioned his political image by touting his working-class upbringing in Scranton, Pennsylvania.</p> </div></div> <div data-type="text" class="crd clln--it"> <div class=" crd--cnt "> <p class> His West Wing team, though wealthy, does not include a plethora of the super-rich who worked for Trump, including Gary Cohn and Steve Bannon, a pair of Goldman Sachs alums each worth tens of millions. Some in the progressive wing of the Democratic Party have called for a ban on former lobbyists working in the White House and have urged severing ties with the business world. </p> </div></div> <div data-type="text" class="crd clln--it"> <div class=" crd--cnt "> <p class> National security adviser Jake Sullivan made $5,000 for speaking to J Street, a pro-Israel group, and made a $45,000 from Microsoft for being on an advisory board. Microsoft earlier this month was the victim of a major hack that Biden discussed with the leaders of India, Japan and Australia at a virtual summit this month, according to Sullivan. </p> </div></div> <div data-type="text" class="crd clln--it"> <div class=" crd--cnt "> <p class> Like Sullivan, Susan Rice, now the head of the domestic policy council, was a member of the Obama administration. She also made money on the speaking circuit, including $81,000 for an appearance for the Cambridge Speakers Series, and she pocketed $13,500 for op-ed contributions to The New York Times.</p> </div></div>  <div data-type="text" class="crd clln--it"> <div class=" crd--cnt "> <p class="stop-here"> Mike Donilon, a senior adviser, was a managing member of MCD Strategies, a media consulting firm, prior to his role in the White House.
