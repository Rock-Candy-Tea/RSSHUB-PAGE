This week marked the arrival of Qt 6.1 Beta 2 for providing the latest bug fixes for this cross-platform toolkit ahead of the planned release next month.
<br>
<br><a href="https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=search&q=Qt+6.1">Qt 6.1</a> beta launched just at the start of March while now the second beta has arrived while at least three more betas are expected over the coming weeks.
<br>
<br>The Qt Company continues to aim for releasing the Qt 6.1 toolkit around the end of April, which is part of their plan for shipping Qt 6.1/6.2 sooner than they would otherwise be with their conventional six month release cycle in wanting to get Qt6 into shape quicker. At the moment the <a href="https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTBUG-91423?filter=22963">blocker bug list</a> indicates just under a dozen blocker bugs.
<br>
<br>Qt 6.1 brings Qt Lottie to the Qt6 world after not making it for 6.0, Qt State Machines for providing SCXML and StateMachine modules in the Qt6 world, the Qt Virtual Keyboard is also now available on Qt 6 with various improvements too, and Qt Device Utilities has been introduced with various networking features. Qt 6.1 also introduces new overflow-safe arithmetic functions to Qt Core, the Vulkan API wrappers for Qt GUI now expose Vulkan 1.1/1.2 core APIs, support for SSL plugins in QtNetwork were added, QNetworkInformation is new for exposing system networking information, and QtQuick3D has a technology preview of instanced rendering support. In a tech preview state for Qt 6.1 is QtQuick3D's 3D particles for 3D scenes.
<br>
<br>The brief Qt 6.1 Beta 2 release announcement can be found on the <a href="https://lists.qt-project.org/pipermail/development/2021-March/041157.html">mailing list</a>.
<br>
<br>Also notable in Qt news for this past week is The Qt Company looking to revive the Qt-Project.org domain. Qt-Project.org formerly was the main project site for the open-source community project while currently just served as a redirect to Qt.io, which is of course controlled by The Qt Company and primarily focused on pushing The Qt Company's wares.
<br>
<br><a href="https://lists.qt-project.org/pipermail/development/2021-March/041149.html">Proposed</a> this week was reviving Qt-Project.org and using it as the "face" of the open-source Qt project. In particular, Qt-Project.org will emphasize how open-source developers can contribute to the open-source project and not to duplicate the content from Qt.io. The proposed initial look and early data for the project site can be found on <a href="https://qt-project-org.herokuapp.com/">this page</a>. So far it seems the Qt community is excited about seeing Qt-Project.org restored with a focus on encouraging contributor.
