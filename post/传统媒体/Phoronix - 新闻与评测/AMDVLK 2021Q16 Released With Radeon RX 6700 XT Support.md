Following yesterday's release of the Radeon RX 6700 XT graphics card and the updated <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=Radeon-SW-Linux-RX-6700-XT">Radeon Software for Linux 20.50 driver</a>, AMD has now released AMDVLK 2021.Q1.6 as their updated open-source Vulkan driver with Navi 22 / RX 6700 XT support.
<br>
<br>AMDVLK 2021.Q1.6 as the company's official open-source AMD Vulkan driver on Linux systems now carries RX 6700 XT / Navi 22 support. This is, of course, contingent upon AMDGPU support in the Linux kernel DRM driver which as outlined in my earlier review is in good shape for Linux 5.11+, assuming you have the Navy Flounder AMDGPU firmware files present on your system.
<br>
<br>Mesa has already been exposing RX 6700 XT support for both its RADV Vulkan driver and RadeonSI OpenGL driver. See the <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/vr.php?view=30032">Radeon RX 6700 XT Linux review</a> for the Mesa-based benchmarks and other driver support details.

<br>Now with today's <a href="https://github.com/GPUOpen-Drivers/AMDVLK/releases/tag/v-2021.Q1.6">AMDVLK 2021.Q1.6</a> driver there is this Radeon RX 6700 series support and as such will be working on some fresh benchmarks there shortly along with the 20.50 packaged driver. No other changes are found with this latest AMDVLK update.
