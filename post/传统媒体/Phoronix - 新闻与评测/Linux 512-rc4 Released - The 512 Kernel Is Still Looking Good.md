The fourth weekly release candidate to <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=search&q=Linux+5.12">Linux 5.12</a> is now available for testing ahead of its anticipated stable release next month.
<br>
<br>Linux 5.12 overall continues to be quite calm and much better off than early on when 5.12-rc1 was <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=Linux-5.12-Corruption-Fixed">rocked by a nasty data corruption issue</a>.
<br>
<br>Linus Torvalds simply wrote of <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/CAHk-=whDxybSS63==ycQiNobvamDmoyxQo1JL-31Tup8azbeWw@mail.gmail.com/T/#u">5.12-rc4</a>, "<em>Very much an average rc4, possibly just a tad on the smaller side of average. Nothing here particularly stands out. The diffstat looks a bit more spread out than it perhaps normally would do, because of the removal of the (never used) MODULE_SUPPORTED_DEVICE() thing that causes some trivial line removal in various drivers, but not only did it never do anything, it wasn't actually even all that common (ie it certainly wasn't a "most drivers" kind of situation).</em>"
<br>
<br>Thus barring anything nasty from coming up late in the cycle, Linux 5.12 is looking good for being another average and on-schedule release.
