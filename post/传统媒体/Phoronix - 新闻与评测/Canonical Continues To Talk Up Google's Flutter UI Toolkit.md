Recently Ubuntu maker Canonical committed to using Google's Flutter user-interface toolkit as its "default choice" for their mobile and desktop applications moving forward. There is now an Ubuntu Blog post further detailing their interests in Flutter.
<br>
<br>Canonical has been working with Google on the Flutter Linux port, the toolkit that aims to provide multi-platform support from a single code-base and built off the Dart platform. Canonical has been crafting Flutter to ensure it works well on Ubuntu systems, including with the use of Snap packaging. Canonical is also making use of Flutter for their new desktop installer while recently they committed to using Flutter as well for their future applications.
<br>
<br>Rhys Davies reaffirmed today, "<em>we are making sure Flutter is a first-class experience and stays high on our list of platforms for consideration when designing future mobile and desktop apps.</em>"  They are encouraging the use of Flutter for greater cross-platform compatibility, the Ubuntu desktop team working to ensure Flutter apps integrate well, and that it's a first-class citizen for Snaps and in Snapcraft.
<br>
<br>As for their expressed reasons for their Flutter ambitions in Ubuntu, "<em>Flutter is a truly cross-platform tool and is open source. If the Linux ecosystem at large picks this up there is a tremendous opportunity for massive ecosystem expansion. The vast majority of Flutter’s codebase is written in Dart code (using Dart only packages), and just works with no modifications necessary across all the platforms. And since the announcement in July last year, the number of plugins is slowly but surely increasing for Linux. Cross-platform development doesn’t just mean Linux developers can write apps for other platforms, it means Flutter developers for any other platform can contribute their apps to Linux and expand the Linux app ecosystem indefinitely.</em>"
