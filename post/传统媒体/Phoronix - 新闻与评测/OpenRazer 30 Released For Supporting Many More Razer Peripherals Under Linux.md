While Razer has talked up Linux support in the past, so far they have not officially offered Linux support for their range of wares popular with gamers. However, thanks to the open-source community there has been the likes of <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=search&q=OpenRazer">OpenRazer</a> offering up support for the company's keyboards, mice, and other peripherals under Linux thanks to reverse engineering. Today marks the release of OpenRazer 3.0 for furthering this effort.
<br>
<br>OpenRazer 3.0 is out as the fully open-source driver and user-space daemon for interfacing with Razer peripherals under Linux. OpenRazer allows configuring various device settings like LED lighting, mouse sensitivity, and more for Razer's keyboards, mice, mousemats, headsets, and other peripherals. OpenRazer supports pretty much all of the Razer peripherals of recent years and in turn is used by various Linux GUI solutions like Polychromatic.
<br>
<br>With OpenRazer 3.0 there is finally support for persistent storage of effects in the daemon so that the GUI front-ends can retrieve the effects for a device that had been set. This persistent storage support was achieved in part thanks to well known Phoronix editor Tildearrow.

<br>OpenRazer 3.0 also adds support for DPI stages to mice and fixes a number of bugs. Plus there are many more Razer devices now supported with OpenRazer. Razer's Blade Stealth Late 2020, DeathAdder V2 Pro, Mouse Bungee V3 Chroma, Ornata Chroma V2, DeathAdder V2 Mini, Base Station V2 Chroma, Firefly V2, Naga Left-Handed Edition, Book 13 2020, Basilisk V2, Cynosa Chroma Pro, Basilisk Ultimate, Mouse Dock, Charging Pad Chroma, and Huntsman Mini are now all supported by OpenRazer 3.0.
