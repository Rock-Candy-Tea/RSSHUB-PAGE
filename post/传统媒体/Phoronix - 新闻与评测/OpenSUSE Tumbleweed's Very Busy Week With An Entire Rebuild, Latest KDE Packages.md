For users of the rolling-release openSUSE Tumbleweed distribution, it's been a very active past week.
<br>
<br>First up was an entire rebuild of the distribution, which seldom occurs among distributions especially rolling-release distributions where it can then mean multi-gigabyte updates. This latest openSUSE Tumbleweed rebuild of all packages is as a result of picking up the latest GNU C Library (glibc) patches.
<br>
<br>Some of the targeted updates recently in openSUSE Tumbleweed include moving to KDE Frameworks 5.80, Flatpak 1.10.2, an updated systemd 246, Linux 5.11.6, SQLite 3.35, KDE Plasma 5.21.2, Thunderbird 78.8.1, and many other package updates.
