FreeCAD 0.19 was released this weekend as the newest major feature release for this respected open-source CAD solution / parametric 3D modeling solution.
<br>
<br>FreeCAD 0.19 is now "essentially complete" in its migration from Python 2 to Python 3 as well as Qt4 to Qt5. FreeCAD 0.19 at the UI level brings improvements to its navigation cube, new icon theme management, a new dark stylesheet, a lot of work on dynamic properties, improved backup file handling, glTF support, a new WebGL exporter, new Arch Fence and Arch Truss tools, continued work on the FEM Workbench, the Render Workbench added support for Blender's standalone Cycles renderer, and much more.

<br>FreeCAD 0.19 is quite an exciting and noteworthy release. Those into computer aided design can find out more about this big FreeCAD update over on <a href="https://wiki.freecadweb.org/Release_notes_0.19">the FreeCAD Wiki</a>.
<br>
<br><em>For those into FreeCAD scripting or know of other solutions, I am still very much interested in coming up with a FreeCAD performance benchmark for use with the Phoronix Test Suite and OpenBenchmarking.org. Sadly there still doesn't seem to be anything I am aware of for benchmarking FreeCAD. Please let me know if there is.</em>
