As we get ready for spring, KDE developers continue polishing up their Wayland support for the Plasma 5.22 cycle.
<br>
<br>It's been another busy week in KDE land especially on the Wayland/XWayland front while other areas of the free desktop stack have also been enjoying improvements. Some of the noteworthy KDE improvements this past week include:
<br>
<br>- KDE Connect now supports replying to text messages from within the Plasma notification itself.
<br>
<br>- The audio volume applet with the applications tab will now show what audio output device a given application is outputting to when hovering over the application name.
<br>
<br>- KDE Partition Manager now reports the SMART status for all disks.
<br>
<br>- Okular now behaves correctly for multi-monitor systems with different scaling factors.
<br>
<br>- Pasting saved Klipper text into GTK applications under a KDE Plasma session now works.
<br>
<br>- XWayland now responds immediately to fractional scaling factor changes rather than the current behavior of first needing a system restart.
