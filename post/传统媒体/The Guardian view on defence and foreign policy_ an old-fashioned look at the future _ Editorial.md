Two of these confront democracies around the world. But the last is a self-inflicted wound, which the government appears determined to deepen. And the need to deal with the first two is not in itself a solution to the third, as this policy paper sometimes seems to imagine.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/mar/16/the-guardian-view-on-defence-and-foreign-policy-an-old-fashioned-look-at-the-future">Continue reading...</a>
