                            <p>After successfully muzzling Hong Kong’s democracy protests and opposition, Beijing’s loyalists have warned art institutions about their collections as they seek to impose mainland-style orthodoxy on culture and purge the city of dissent.</p> 
<p>Newly built on Hong Kong’s Victoria Harbour, M+ Museum aims to rival western contemporary heavyweights like London’s Tate Modern and New York’s MoMA.</p> 
<p>The 60,000 square-metre venue is finally set to open later this year after multiple delays. But it has already found itself in hot water.</p> 
 
<p>Earlier this week a group of prominent pro-Beijing local politicians accused the museum of breaching a sweeping national security law that China imposed on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/hong-kong" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" data-component="auto-linked-tag" class="u-underline">Hong Kong</a> last year in response to 2019’s democracy protests.</p> 
<p>The cause of the complaint, filed to police on Tuesday, was the content of a media preview, including works by dissident Chinese artist Ai Weiwei.</p> 
<p>“Many of the pieces are spreading hatred against the country,” pro-Beijing lawmaker Eunice Yung said in a recent question to city leader Carrie Lam in the legislature.</p> 
<p>“Will the government censor the collection? What will the government do to prevent such provocation of anti-China sentiments?” she added.</p> 
<p>Lam, a pro-Beijing appointee, replied that Hong Kong “respects the freedom of cultural and artistic expression”.</p> 
<p>But she warned authorities would be on “full alert” for any breaches of the security law, adding that the red line “is clearly recognisable” for anyone hosting exhibitions.</p> 
<p>The exchange sent a new shudder through the arts scene in a city struggling to hold onto its reputation as an international cultural gateway to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/china" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" data-component="auto-linked-tag" class="u-underline">China</a> unhindered from the authoritarian mainland’s controls.</p> 
 
<p>Insiders say self-censorship had been on the rise in recent years.</p> 
<p>But the broad wording of Hong Kong’s national security law – and the fervour with which influential pro-Beijing figures wish to see it applied – now adds a whole extra layer of risk.</p> 
<p>“People are just a little deflated and anxious,” one art expert involved in major exhibitions at museums said, asking to remain anonymous.</p> 
<p>The law targets anything deemed “secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces” and has quickly criminalised a host of political views.</p> 
<p>“Now in the ever-widening definition of things that could undermine national security in Hong Kong, we should add pieces of art,” Peter Lewis, a radio presenter with RTHK wrote on Twitter earlier this week.</p> 
<p>China promised Hong Kong could keep a level of autonomy and freedom ahead of its 1997 handover by Britain. But it has ramped up control since democracy protests exploded.</p> 
<p>M+ is not the only cultural canary to be caught up in this new patriotic drive.</p> 
 
<p>Wen Wei Po and Ta Kung Pao – two newspapers that answer to Beijing’s Liaison Office – have published multiple articles recently attacking “subversive” content in Hong Kong’s arts scene, primarily projects that deal with the democracy movement.</p> 
<p>Earlier this month Wen Wei Po led a successful campaign to halt the first commercial screening of an award-winning documentary on the protests, saying it “spread hatred against our country”.</p> 
<p>Meanwhile Ta Kung Pao accused the government-appointed Arts Development Council of being led by “anti-government figures” who approved funding for “seditious projects”.</p> 
<p>The council responded, saying it would review upcoming grants and ensure nothing “deemed offending the current laws of Hong Kong” would receive funding.</p> 
<p>Retired journalism professor To Yiu-ming said Ta Kung Pao and Wen Wei Po were like weather vanes for working out where Beijing expects the new cultural red lines to be drawn in Hong Kong.</p> 
<p>“When the papers speak, the government will follow,” he said .</p> 
<p>“Hong Kong is heading down a path where all parts of the society, from political actions to people’s daily life, will be measured by political correctness.”</p> 
<p>Back at M+, curators will have to navigate Hong Kong’s rapidly changing cultural sands as opening day approaches.</p> 
<p>In a statement this week it said it hoped its exhibitions will “stimulate discussion, research, learning, knowledge and pleasure”, adding: “We will comply with the laws of Hong Kong whilst maintaining the highest level of professional integrity.”</p>
