Robert Aaron Long told investigators sex addiction led him to violence, but lawmakers and anti-racism advocates have said anti-Asian bias could have been at least part of the motivation.</p>  <p>"I'm not interested in whether or not he had a bad day," said Warnock, criticizing a comment by an Atlanta-area sheriff's department spokesman about Long's state of mind.</p>  <p>"No matter how you want to spin it, the facts remain the same," Georgia State Rep. Bee Nguyen told the crowd. "This was an attack on the Asian community."</p>  <div><span><figure class="imageMedia image full"><div class="placeholder"><div class="placeholderImage" style="padding-bottom:66.94%"></div><img loading="lazy" alt srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5958098.1616284741!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_300/crime-georgia-spas.JPG 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5958098.1616284741!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_460/crime-georgia-spas.JPG 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5958098.1616284741!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_620/crime-georgia-spas.JPG 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5958098.1616284741!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_780/crime-georgia-spas.JPG 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5958098.1616284741!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_1180/crime-georgia-spas.JPG 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5958098.1616284741!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_780/crime-georgia-spas.JPG" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></div><figcaption class="image-caption">Demonstrators rally outside the Georgia State Capitol in Atlanta on Saturday. <!-- --> <!-- -->(Shannon Stapleton/Reuters)</figcaption></figure></span></div>  <p>Some of the women killed were immigrants and mothers, described by family and friends as hard-working, loving and beloved.</p>  <p>Hyun Jung Grant was among those killed at Gold Spa in Atlanta.

Since Tuesday, mourners have piled flower bouquets and signs, lit candles and said prayers outside the spas where the victims were killed.</p>  <p>U.S. lawmakers decried the spike in anti-Asian violence in a congressional hearing on Thursday, where Democratic Rep. Grace Meng, who is of Taiwanese descent, testified that the "community is bleeding."</p>  <p>On Friday, U.S. President Joe Biden and Vice-President Kamala Harris met with Asian American community leaders in Georgia to <a href="http://cbc.ca/1.5957123">express condolences</a> and implore Americans to stand together against hate.</p></span></div>
