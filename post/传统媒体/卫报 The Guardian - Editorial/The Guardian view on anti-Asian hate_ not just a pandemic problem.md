<p>The killings in Atlanta come in the context of a recent global surge in abuse and assaults, with deeper roots<br></p><p>The fear, anger and heartbreak felt when news broke that eight people had been killed in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/mar/17/atlanta-spa-shootings-what-we-know-so-far" title>shootings in Atlanta</a> on Wednesday, six of them women of Asian descent, was multiplied by the extraordinary response of authorities: “Yesterday was a really bad day for him,” a Georgia sheriff’s captain <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/mar/17/jay-baker-bad-day-t-shirt-atlanta-spa-shooting" title>remarked</a> of the suspect.</p><p>For many Asian Americans, it was further evidence that crimes against their community <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/mar/18/fbi-pressure-anti-asian-hate-crime-atlanta" title>are not being taken seriously</a>, even as they surge.

(The first federal anti-immigration law in the US <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Page_Act_of_1875" title>targeted Chinese women</a>, on a pretext of tackling prostitution, but in reality to prevent Chinese families from settling.) Wednesday’s victims were <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/mar/18/atlanta-spa-shootings-anti-sex-worker-racism-sexism" title>regarded as sex workers</a>, whether or not that was the case.
