                            <p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">A</span></span> year ago, as the reality of Covid lockdown hit home, evangelists for the work of Marcel Proust spotted a window of opportunity. Domestic confinement had eliminated the usual distractions, and pandemic reading lists invariably carried a namecheck for Proust’s monumental seven-volume classic, In Search of Lost Time. A significant uplift in online sales <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/mar/25/book-sales-surge-self-isolating-readers-bucket-list-novels" title data-link-name="in body link" class="u-underline">was duly reported</a>.</p> 
<p>Cynics might point out that most purchases were limited to Swann’s Way, the first book in the series; only a post-pandemic audit will be able to establish how many readers journeyed through all 4,215 pages. But, whether he was read, unread, or merely dabbled with, literature’s patron saint of introspection was an appropriate hero for the era of self-isolation. In the last years of his life, toiling incessantly on the vast text, Proust rarely left the cork-lined cocoon of his bedroom. One biographer <a href="https://www.openculture.com/2020/03/the-cork-lined-bedroom-and-writing-room-of-marcel-proust.html" title data-link-name="in body link" class="u-underline">describes</a> him writing “from a semi-recumbent position, suspended midway between the realms of sleeping and waking using his knees as a desk”. During the latest, longest, lockdown, this modus operandi may have become familiar to millions, albeit without a similarly significant end product.</p> 
<p>Serendipitously, as the prospect of release finally becomes real, Proust is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/feb/16/unseen-work-by-proust-announced-french-publisher-the-seventy-five-pages" title data-link-name="in body link" class="u-underline">back in the news</a>. On 1 April, the French publishing house Gallimard will bring out an edition of long-lost early sketches that throw new light on his great work. Entitled simply The Seventy-Five Pages, this short volume was written between 1907 and 1908, 14 years before the writer’s death. Rumours of its existence had been around for decades. But the manuscript only turned up in 2018, buried in documents left to the National Library of France by a publisher friend of the Proust family.</p> 
<p>An English translation has yet to be announced. But for those who failed to follow through with the good intentions of last March, here is another, perhaps more manageable, opportunity. According to <a href="https://twitter.com/AmisDeProust/status/1369995381321441280/photo/3" title data-link-name="in body link" class="u-underline">early accounts</a>, The Seventy-Five Pages contains embryonic formulations of some of the most important themes of the great work to come, including Jewish identity and same-sex desire. While autobiographical references are later disguised and transformed, Proust’s beloved mother and maternal grandmother appear here by name, while his Jewish great-uncle, Louis Weil, emerges for the first time as an obvious prototype of the fictional Charles Swann. As <a href="https://www.nouvelobs.com/bibliobs/20210314.OBS41356/manuscrits-inedits-de-proust-c-est-comme-si-on-atteignait-au-c-ur-de-la-recherche.html" title data-link-name="in body link" class="u-underline">one</a> reviewer phrased it this week, the reader is allowed a glimpse of “the construction site of the cathedral”.</p> 
<p>The whole Proustian enterprise was, famously, an unrivalled reflection on the nature of time. As this literary treasure underlines, Proust worked obsessively upon the scenes of his past, drafting, redrafting, setting to one side and starting again. His aim was to capture the mysterious and elusive texture of lived time itself. The method involved an almost claustrophobic attention to detail and the myriad factors that contributed to the “feel” of a particular time and place. As Proust <a href="https://creativeprocessinsights.com/2019/01/13/creative-process-marcel-proust-writing-the-novel/" title data-link-name="in body link" class="u-underline">once</a> observed: “I am like a person who has a tapestry too large for the walls of his rooms and who has had to cut it.” Most of us are now desperate to leave our own version of those rooms and re-enter the busyness of the world. But when we come to reflect on this strangest of years, it might just be worth keeping Proust (in long or short form) on the reading list.</p>
