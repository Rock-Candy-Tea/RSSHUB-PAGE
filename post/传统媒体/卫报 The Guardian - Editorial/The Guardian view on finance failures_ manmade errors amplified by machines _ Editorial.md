<p>Markets aren’t working when a system makes Elon Musk billions by adding his company Tesla to the US stock index</p><p>The late economist Hyman Minsky was a pioneer in understanding finance’s grip on the US economy – and the consequences for society. In the 1980s, he predicted the rise of “<a href="https://digitalcommons.bard.edu/hm_archive/13/" title>money manager capitalism</a>” and foresaw that institutional investors would become masters of the universe. Today, we are in a world of “money machine manager capitalism”, where <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/e689a67e-2911-11e8-b27e-cc62a39d57a0" title>algorithms</a> control the buying and selling of securities. Those paid to pick shares, mindful perhaps that their sales pitch was being undermined, claim such passive investing is “<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2016-08-24/are-index-funds-communist" title>worse than Marxism</a>”.

But artificial intelligence is blurring the distinction. Computers run investment portfolios offering cheap “exchange-traded funds” that automatically track indices of shares and bonds. This has been so successful that the big three – US firms BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street – now manage <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/983542f1-151d-4fae-947a-6509967183aa" title>$19tn in assets</a>, roughly a tenth of the world’s quoted securities.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/mar/21/the-guardian-view-on-finance-failures-manmade-errors-amplified-by-machines">Continue reading...</a>
