"And in the future, when we have our 20 million doses coming in, we will return that amount to the U.S."</p>  <h2>Minister 'raised the importance' of J&J's schedule</h2>  <p>When asked whether the United States — which has been vaccinating its residents at a rate four times faster than Canada — would consider also releasing Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna doses, the minister said Canada has a robust vaccine portfolio of its own.</p>  <p>"But my strategy is also to try to accelerate doses from one quarter to the next," Anand said. "So while we have this diversified portfolio, by the same token, we are exploring all options to make sure we have the earliest deliveries for Canadians."</p>  <div><span><figure class="imageMedia image full"><div class="placeholder"><div class="placeholderImage" style="padding-bottom:66.61%"></div><img loading="lazy" alt srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5953521.1616005844!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/cvid-cda-20201213.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5953521.1616005844!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/cvid-cda-20201213.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5953521.1616005844!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/cvid-cda-20201213.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5953521.1616005844!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/cvid-cda-20201213.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5953521.1616005844!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/cvid-cda-20201213.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5953521.1616005844!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/cvid-cda-20201213.jpg" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></div><figcaption class="image-caption">Minister of Public Services and Procurement Canada Anita Anand oversees the off-loading of COVID-19 vaccines from a cargo aircraft with members of Canadian Border Services Agency in Montreal on Sunday, December 13, 2020.<!-- --> <!-- -->(The Canadian Press/HO-Canadian Armed Forces-Cpl Matthew Tower)</figcaption></figure></span></div>  <p>One approved vaccine awaiting a delivery schedule is the single-dose Johnson & Johnson shot. </p>  <p>"I spoke with [Johnson & Johnson] on Thursday and in particular raised the importance of a delivery schedule as soon as possible so that the provinces and territories can do their planning," Anand said.  </p>  <p>Canada has inked a deal for up to 38 million doses of the vaccine, which does not need the same cold storage required by the Pfizer and Moderna shots.</p>  <p>"We have to remember, though, that while we need a delivery schedule from J&J — and AstraZeneca, for those 20 million doses coming in from AZ — we already are seeing millions and millions of doses coming into this country from Pfizer, from Moderna, indeed, two million doses coming in next week," Anand said.</p>  <div><span><ul class="similarLinks"><li class="similarListItem"><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/how-approval-of-johnson-johnson-s-one-and-done-covid-19-vaccine-could-change-canada-s-vaccination-game-1.5928528" class="similarLink" data-contentid flag text="How approval of Johnson & Johnson's 'one and done' COVID-19 vaccine could change Canada's vaccination game"><span class="similarLinkText">How approval of Johnson & Johnson's 'one and done' COVID-19 vaccine could change Canada's vaccination game</span></a></li></ul></span><span><ul class="similarLinks"><li class="similarListItem"><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/trudeau-johnson-vaccine-production-1.5942680" class="similarLink" data-contentid flag text="Trudeau says J&J vaccine faces production challenges"><span class="similarLinkText">Trudeau says J&J vaccine faces production challenges</span></a></li></ul></span></div>  <h2>Waiting her turn for a shot</h2>  <p>Anand said that she and her two sisters act as a personal caregivers for her father.
