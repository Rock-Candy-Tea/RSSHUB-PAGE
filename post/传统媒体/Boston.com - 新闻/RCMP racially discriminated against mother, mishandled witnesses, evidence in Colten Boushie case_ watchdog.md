Boushie's family had complained to the RCMP about insensitive treatment and appealed to the CRCC for an independent review. </p>  <p>Officers visited Baptiste's home on the Red Pheasant reserve on the night of the shooting. They were there to break the news of Boushie's death and search the home for a witness they believed might have a gun.</p>  <p>While finding no signs of discrimination in officers' approach and search of the home, the CRCC found evidence of discrimination during "the police's conduct towards Ms. Baptiste with respect to her sobriety and her credibility."

Given the historic distrust of police by Indigenous communities, the trauma, shock and chaos of the previous day's events, the lack of sleep, the lodging in cells and the potentially severe hangovers the witnesses suffered, the commission found that the RCMP interviewers did not reasonably foster a state of mind that was conducive to witness co-operation."</p>  <p>After they gave their statements, Boushie's friends were detained longer than is justified under the Criminal Code, the CRCC also reported.</p>  <p>The commission is asking the RCMP to review its policy to address the treatment of non-suspect witnesses held in custody. </p>  <p>The union said the witnesses were offered food, water and sleep "to give them an opportunity to sober up and rest from the previous day."</p>  <p>After more than 16 hours of rest, the witnesses each verbally confirmed they understood they were being asked to give witness statements, the union added.</p>  <h2>Training on witness handling also needed: CRCC</h2>  <p>The CRCC also scrutinized how the RCMP handled Gerald Stanley's wife, Leesa, and his son, Sheldon, who were at the farm on the day of the shooting.</p>  <p>The report said it was unreasonable that four officers — including the sergeant in charge of the initial scene — did not ensure that Leesa or Sheldon Stanley did not discuss the shooting with each other before giving their statements to police.</p>  <p>Sheldon testified during the trial that after Gerald Stanley shot Boushie at close range, but before police arrived, the Stanleys retreated to their house to sit and have coffee in silence.</p>  <p>Leesa Stanley did not testify at her husband's trial.</p>  <p>The RCMP should provide training on witness handling to the officers involved, the CRCC said. </p>  <h2>Lack of communication hampered investigation </h2>  <p>The CRCC listed other concerns about the RCMP's work, some of which came out <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatoon/colten-boushie-gerald-stanley-trial-begins-saskatchewan-1.4501897"><u>during trial testimony</u></a>.</p>  <p>The SUV that Boushie was shot in went uncovered, and rain washed away some blood evidence. The RCMP did not ask a blood spatter specialist to come to the scene.</p>  <p>Experts consulted by CBC News agreed that errors were made but did not conclude it would have changed the outcome of the trial.</p>  <p>The CRCC concluded that discrimination was not to blame when it came to issues relating to evidence handling.</p>  <p>However, it wrote, "The lack of communication between the various RCMP units involved in the investigation of the death of Mr. Boushie led to some of the errors and inefficiencies."</p>  <div><span><ul class="similarLinks"><li class="similarListItem"><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatoon/colten-boushie-family-list-problems-gerald-stanley-case-1.4532214" class="similarLink" data-contentid flag text="The long list of problems Colten Boushie's family says marred the case"><span class="similarLinkText">The long list of problems Colten Boushie's family says marred the case</span></a></li></ul></span><span><ul class="similarLinks"><li class="similarListItem"><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatoon/stanley-family-colten-boushie-1.4779425" class="similarLink" data-contentid flag text="Family's civil suit claims Gerald Stanley recklessly caused Colten Boushie's death"><span class="similarLinkText">Family's civil suit claims Gerald Stanley recklessly caused Colten Boushie's death</span></a></li></ul></span></div>  <p>The commission recommended that the RCMP ensure it has enough staff to work on major crimes investigations in a timely manner. It also asked the Saskatchewan division to consider acquiring a mobile command centre, which "could have proven to be useful in this case and potentially resulted in avoiding some of the shortcomings or omissions that occurred.</p>  <p>The recommendations are not binding.</p>  <p>Some of Lucki's responses — which the commission needed to complete its work and publicly disclose its findings — were not sent to the CRCC for more than a year, according to the commission.</p>  <p>"The family should have had answers a lot sooner," Sunchild said. </p>  <h2>Family already pursuing civil action</h2>  <p>The CRCC probe has taken place against the backdrop of an ongoing civil lawsuit filed by Debbie Baptiste and her family against the Attorney General of Canada, the office that is representing the RCMP in court.</p>  <p>Filed in August 2018, on the second anniversary of Boushie's death, Baptiste's lawsuit contained even more allegations about the RCMP members who visited her home on the night of her son's fatal shooting.</p>  <p>In a statement of claim, the Baptiste family alleged that officers rode toward the home at high speed, shone spotlights on the house and approached with guns drawn — all of which was denied by the attorney general's office in its statement of defence on behalf of the RCMP.</p>  <div><span><figure class="imageMedia image full"><div class="placeholder"><div class="placeholderImage" style="padding-bottom:75.00%"></div><img loading="lazy" alt srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.4520999.1616263135!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_300/alvin-baptiste-uncle-of-colten-boushie-outside-battleford-courthouse-feb-5-2018.JPG 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.4520999.1616263135!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_460/alvin-baptiste-uncle-of-colten-boushie-outside-battleford-courthouse-feb-5-2018.JPG 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.4520999.1616263135!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_620/alvin-baptiste-uncle-of-colten-boushie-outside-battleford-courthouse-feb-5-2018.JPG 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.4520999.1616263135!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_780/alvin-baptiste-uncle-of-colten-boushie-outside-battleford-courthouse-feb-5-2018.JPG 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.4520999.1616263135!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_1180/alvin-baptiste-uncle-of-colten-boushie-outside-battleford-courthouse-feb-5-2018.JPG 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.4520999.1616263135!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_780/alvin-baptiste-uncle-of-colten-boushie-outside-battleford-courthouse-feb-5-2018.JPG" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></div><figcaption class="image-caption">Colten Boushie's uncle, Alvin Baptiste, filed the complaint about RCMP conduct on behalf of the family. <!-- --> <!-- -->(Guy Quenneville/CBC)</figcaption></figure></span></div>  <p>"RCMP members treated the [family] reasonably, respectfully and courteously," the statement of defence said.</p>  <p>The Baptiste family also claimed that an officer leaned in to smell Debbie Baptiste's breath and that an officer checked the microwave after being told Boushie's dinner was being kept there.</p>  <p>The court file was last updated in May 2020 to indicate that "the requirements for mediation in this action have been met."</p>  <p>Brian Pfefferle, a Saskatoon criminal lawyer who closely followed the Gerald Stanley trial, said that court update suggests the family and the RCMP completed the mandatory mediation without reaching a settlement.</p></span></div>
