anecdotes about butter that doesn't spread as easily as it once did. <br> <br> That led some food scientists to theorize that palmitic acid from palm oil had been added in greater quantities to cow feed to boost milk output and increase the fat content needed to make butter, in the face of what the dairy industry has described as unprecedented demand.<br> <br> But as a joint investigation from <em>Marketplace </em>and <em>The National </em>reports, a lab test of 17 popular Ontario butter brands suggests a derivative of palm oil is not the sole cause of the unusually hard butter that some Canadians have been complaining about. <a href="https://protect-eu.mimecast.com/s/HrzqC5Wrrs6OPKOIx6E6J?domain=newsletters.cbc.ca" target="_blank">Read more</a></p>  <div><span><span

return equipment due to lockdown</h2>  <p>The family of a 91-year-old woman is outraged Rogers had demanded she pay hundreds of dollars for failing to return phone and internet equipment while her Ottawa long-term care home was under lockdown.<br> <br> They cancelled those services for Joan Davis in early May after noticing her dementia was worsening and she was struggling to use them.<br> <br> Her daughter, Lori Davis, says Rogers told the family a technician would pick up the equipment, but nobody showed up.<br> <br> What did show up was a bill for the unreturned equipment — more than $450 which, by this month, had grown to almost $565. <br> <br> Lori is just one of about a dozen telco customers who contacted Go Public with complaints about Rogers and Bell charging penalties for situations brought on by COVID-19 that are out of customers' control — most dealing with financial hardship brought on by the pandemic.<br> <br> Meanwhile, Rogers reversed the charges, and is promising to review its policy after Go Public's inquiries. <a href="https://protect-eu.mimecast.com/s/SM6YC89xxfYx5MxtRYNke?domain=newsletters.cbc.ca" target="_blank">Read more</a></p>  <h2>Provinces
