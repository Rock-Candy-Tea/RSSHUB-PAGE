"That's directly attacking me as an Asian Canadian."</p>  <p>Michael Chong, the Conservative MP for Wellington—Halton Hills, said he experiences discrimination regularly in emails and social media posts directed at him — racism that predates the pandemic.</p>  <p>"As the first Canadian of Chinese descent elected from the province of Ontario, I know full well firsthand what it is like to be subject to Asian discrimination," said Chong.</p>  <p>Chong said discrimination can be fuelled by rhetoric and comments from political leaders and other public figures, such as former U.S. president Donald Trump calling coronavirus the "China virus."</p>  <p>He also referenced comments from former CSIS director Richard Fadden in 2010, when he claimed that several unnamed Canadian politicians were under the sway of the Chinese government.</p>  <div><span><ul class="similarLinks"><li class="similarListItem"><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/stop-asian-hate-racism-rally-atlanta-spa-shooting-1.5958081" class="similarLink" data-contentid flag text="'We are not the virus': Hundreds rally against anti-Asian racism in Atlanta"><span class="similarLinkText">'We are not the virus': Hundreds rally against anti-Asian racism in Atlanta</span></a></li></ul></span><span><ul class="similarLinks"><li class="similarListItem"><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/georgia-shooting-hate-crime-1.5954300" class="similarLink" data-contentid flag text="Asian Americans fearful after Georgia massage parlour shootings"><span class="similarLinkText">Asian Americans fearful after Georgia massage parlour shootings</span></a></li></ul></span></div>  <p>"Those kinds of comments are not helpful, said Chong.

Dong added that the Liberal government has implemented a number of programs to tackle anti-Asian racism as part of its <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/canadian-heritage/campaigns/anti-racism-engagement/anti-racism-strategy.html">Anti-Racism Strategy</a>.</p>  <p>But Kwan said she believes more needs to be done.</p>  <p>"I remain shocked at the fact that across the country not every single police department has a hate crime unit.
