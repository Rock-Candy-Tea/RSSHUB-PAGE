U.S. prosecutors accuse Huawei and Meng of violating American sanctions on Iran.</p>  <p>Many Western analysts and politicians believe their arrests are an attempt to pressure Canada to release Meng.</p>  <p>Canadian officials have called the arrests of Kovrig and Spavor "arbitrary," and China has yet to make public specific allegations or provide any evidence of wrongdoing.
