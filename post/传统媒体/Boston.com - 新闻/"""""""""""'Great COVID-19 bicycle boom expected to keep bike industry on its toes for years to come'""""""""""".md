Market research firm NPD Group says Canadian numbers aren't tracked, but in the United States, sales of bicycles increased 75 per cent in 2020 compared with a year earlier. For the first two months of 2021, the increase year over year was 130 per cent.</p>  <p>But there's also a supply-side problem, including a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-16/shortage-of-new-shipping-containers-adds-to-global-trade-turmoil" target="_blank">shortage of shipping containers</a> and understaffing along parts of the supply chain due to physical distancing to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.</p>  <h2>'It's pretty zany when we open'</h2>  <p>It all adds up to an unprecedented time for Canadian cycle shops.</p>  <p>"Most days it's pretty zany when we open," said Smith, who also own a second Vancouver location, Central Valley Flat Fix.</p>  <p>Smith said she expects simpler bikes, like those sought by people looking for their first bicycle as an adult, to be sold out by May or June.</p>  <div><span><ul class="similarLinks"><li class="similarListItem"><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/winnipeg-bike-business-1.5952439" class="similarLink" data-contentid flag text="Winnipeg bike businesses pedalling hard to keep up with 'crazy' boom"><span class="similarLinkText">Winnipeg bike businesses pedalling hard to keep up with 'crazy' boom</span></a></li></ul></span><span><ul class="similarLinks"><li class="similarListItem"><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/calgary-alberta-bike-shops-surge-supply-demand-supply-cycling-outdoors-inventory-1.5936325" class="similarLink" data-contentid flag text="Surging sales leave Calgary bike shops struggling with demand"><span class="similarLinkText">Surging sales leave Calgary bike shops struggling with demand</span></a></li></ul></span></div>  <p>As for parts, she said one snag can block delivery for a whole shipment of bikes.</p>  <p>"We have one shipment that's waiting entirely on left front brake levers," Smith said, adding that it means someone who wants a custom bike might have to wait until October.</p>  <p>"Everything's just very unknowable," she said.</p>  <h2>Price hike expected </h2>  <p>On the production side, David Régnier-Bourque of Cycles Devinci, in Chicoutimi, Que., said the past year has been "very chaotic."</p>  <p>Régnier-Bourque is the business development director with the company, which produces aluminum bike frames and also imports frames from partners worldwide. He said it takes about 150 parts to make a bicycle.</p>  <p>"It was definitely a huge challenge for us to source parts....

And in more than 12 months, we'll have to re-evaluate if the demand is as high as right now."<br> <br> He said he expects that increased demand will mean a price hike of between five and 15 per cent.</p>  <h2>Near-empty shop 'a little unsettling'</h2>  <p>While the demand has left many people in the industry swamped, it's also left some shops exposed as they wait for more inventory to arrive.</p>  <p>Gordon Robb, who owns MetroCycle in Toronto, says he's received only about 20 per cent of the bicycles he's ordered this year, but he expects more orders to arrive soon, and throughout the summer.</p>  <div><span><figure class="imageMedia image full"><div class="placeholder"><div class="placeholderImage" style="padding-bottom:75.00%"></div><img loading="lazy" alt srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5956411.1616167014!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_300/gordon-robb-owner-metrocycle-toronto.JPG 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5956411.1616167014!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_460/gordon-robb-owner-metrocycle-toronto.JPG 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5956411.1616167014!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_620/gordon-robb-owner-metrocycle-toronto.JPG 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5956411.1616167014!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_780/gordon-robb-owner-metrocycle-toronto.JPG 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5956411.1616167014!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_1180/gordon-robb-owner-metrocycle-toronto.JPG 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5956411.1616167014!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_780/gordon-robb-owner-metrocycle-toronto.JPG" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></div><figcaption class="image-caption">Gordon Robb, owner of MetroCycle in Toronto, says the shop has 'to kind of hold on' and ride out supply issues during the pandemic. <!-- --> <!-- -->(CBC)</figcaption></figure></span></div>  <p>"It is a little unsettling and I am a little worried, but I think we're going to be OK," he said. "We just have to kind of hold on."</p>  <h2>Spring 2023 until things return to normal</h2>  <p>Edward Wright, vice-president for parts and accessories distributor HLC Canada, said the industry and consumers will be dealing with the turmoil caused by the pandemic for years to come.</p>  <p>He said he's "fairly confident" that this time next year, a cycle shopper will have more options than they do now.</p>  <p>But Wright said it won't be until the spring of 2023 "when you'd walk into a shop and experience what you would have experienced in spring 2020" — a choice of many different models and a two-week wait to get your bicycle repaired.</p></span></div>
