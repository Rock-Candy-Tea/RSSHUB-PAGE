He has made mental health awareness a key part of his charitable work.</p>  <p>"We all cope with loss in a different way, but when a parent goes to heaven, I was told their spirit, their love and the memories of them do not," Harry wrote.</p>  <p>"They are always with you, and you can hold on to them forever. I find this to be true."</p></span></div>
