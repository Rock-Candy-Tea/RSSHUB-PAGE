Caroline Duval said injury rates following the use of the carotid hold form a large part of the force's review of the technique.</p>  <h2 style="margin-right:30pt">'Very bad things can happen'</h2>  <p style="margin-right:30pt">Former Ottawa police officer Greg Brown, now a research professor at Carleton University and a postdoctoral fellow at Osgoode Hall Law School, said he was wary of using the carotid hold in the field.</p>  <p style="margin-right:30pt">"I was just always very nervous because when you're compressing the blood flow to somebody's brain at the side of their neck, very bad things can happen," he said.</p>  <p style="margin-right:30pt">While officers have the legal right to protect themselves in life-threatening situations, he said, the neck hold is a relic of 1970s-era policing the RCMP could consider abandoning.</p>  <div style="margin-right:30pt"><span><ul class="similarLinks"><li class="similarListItem"><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/rcmp-mental-health-calls-1.5783529" class="similarLink" data-contentid flag text="RCMP says members have responded to more than 88,000 mental health calls this year"><span class="similarLinkText">RCMP says members have responded to more than 88,000 mental health calls this year</span></a></li></ul></span><span><ul class="similarLinks"><li class="similarListItem"><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/systemic-racism-policing-study-1.5661662" class="similarLink" data-contentid flag text="RCMP's watchdog says force isn't listening to its recommendations on use of force in wellness calls"><span class="similarLinkText">RCMP's watchdog says force isn't listening to its recommendations on use of force in wellness calls</span></a></li></ul></span></div>  <p style="margin-right:30pt">"I would probably not officially sanction this technique. I don't think I would train the technique. I think it's dangerous from a physiological perspective," he said.</p>  <p style="margin-right:30pt">"It's also dangerous from a public relations perspective. The public seems to have a particular issue with this manoeuvre, especially in the light of the issue in Minneapolis with the murder of George Floyd.</p>  <p style="margin-right:30pt">"There's a lot of spotlight on it, a lot of attention, and there's a lot more effective techniques for gaining control over somebody."</p>  <p style="margin-right:30pt">The RCMP said the carotid control is used on average 36 times per year — about once in every 76,000 events involving an RCMP response. According to the RCMP's own data, officers are far more likely to pull out their guns than to use the carotid hold.</p>  <p>"Police officers must make split-second decisions when it comes to responding with intervention options, if necessary," said Duval.</p>  <p>The neck hold's infrequent use is in line with the RCMP's "Incident Management Intervention Model," which teaches officers to use hard force only in extreme cases to control a situation. RCMP officers renew that training every three years through a series of scenario-based exercises.</p>  <div style="margin-right:30pt"><span><figure class="imageMedia image full"><div class="placeholder"><div class="placeholderImage" style="padding-bottom:66.61%"></div><img loading="lazy" alt srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5614561.1592337048!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_300/alain-babineau.JPG 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5614561.1592337048!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_460/alain-babineau.JPG 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5614561.1592337048!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_620/alain-babineau.JPG 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5614561.1592337048!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_780/alain-babineau.JPG 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5614561.1592337048!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_1180/alain-babineau.JPG 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5614561.1592337048!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_780/alain-babineau.JPG" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></div><figcaption class="image-caption">Alain Babineau, a former RCMP officer turned consultant, says that if the force decides to keep recommending the technique, it should require re-qualification training every year.<!-- --> <!-- -->(Charles Contant/CBC)</figcaption></figure></span></div>  <p>Alain Babineau, a consultant on public safety and racial profiling issues and a former RCMP officer, said that if the RCMP decides to keep using the technique, it should require re-qualification training every year, not every three years.</p>  <p>"When applied properly, it works like a charm.

I think, historically, officers have been far too quick to resort to those kinds of techniques. We have other tools, like tasers, pepper spray," he said.</p>  <p>Babineau said police officers coping with "daily stress" and "reduced resources" frequently find themselves under heavy pressure to "resolve an issue very quickly."</p>  <p>"And that kind of pressure leads them to to react, to escalate the force they are going to use in order to get to get compliance, rather than taking the time to resolve an issue with less forceful means," he said.</p>  <h2>Review launched after George Floyd's death</h2>  <p style="margin-right:30pt">The carotid hold differs from the restraint used by Chauvin.
