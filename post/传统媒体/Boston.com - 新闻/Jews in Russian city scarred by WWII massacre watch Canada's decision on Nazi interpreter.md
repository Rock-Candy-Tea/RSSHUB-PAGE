The 1946 Nuremberg tribunal estimated the units were responsible for the execution of more than two million Jews between 1941 and 1944.  </p>  <p>In the summer of 1942, Oberlander's unit moved through Rostov-on-Don.</p>  <p>After the war, in 1954, he moved to Canada and settled in Waterloo, Ont., where he became a successful developer and community leader. But his past was eventually revealed.</p>  <p>According to declassified government documents, it began in 1963, when the RCMP quietly started a file on him after receiving diplomatic information from New York alerting them to Oberlander's presence in Canada and alleging he may have taken part in war crimes.</p>  <p>He would face questions about what happened in Rostov when German investigators looking into war crimes deposed him in Toronto. At that time, Oberlander said he did not know the name of the unit to which he was assigned.</p>  <div><span><figure class="imageMedia image full"><div class="placeholder"><div class="placeholderImage" style="padding-bottom:60.00%"></div><img loading="lazy" alt srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.3668714.1467907933!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/helmut-oberlander.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.3668714.1467907933!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/helmut-oberlander.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.3668714.1467907933!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/helmut-oberlander.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.3668714.1467907933!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/helmut-oberlander.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.3668714.1467907933!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/helmut-oberlander.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.3668714.1467907933!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/helmut-oberlander.jpg" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></div><figcaption class="image-caption">Helmut Oberlander has said he was forcibly conscripted by the Nazis when he was 17 years old.

"I had to guard the grain so that the population could not loot it."</p>  <p>But one of Oberlander's fellow unit members, Leo Marr, repeatedly told German investigators in the '60s that Oberlander was more involved in the operation there. He described an operation in which Jews were processed in a house: men were directed to one room, women to another. They were ordered to strip and remove their jewellery and any valuables before being transported to the ravine.</p>  <p>"Oberlander, the interpreter that I knew, came into our room with a girl of 19 or 20 years of age who still had her clothes on," Marr said. "The girl was crying profusely and swore she was not a Jew, but Russian." Marr testified that Oberlander translated for her and told her she was free to go home.</p>  <p>Oberlander told the authorities he has no recollection of this incident.</p>  <h2>Case became public in '90s</h2>  <p>In 1985, Canada created the Commission of Inquiry on War Criminals, which started an exhaustive review of potential war criminals living in the country. Once-secret documents reveal Oberlander was among 29 cases flagged for special investigation. </p>  <p>The next year, according to the documents, Quebec Superior Court Judge Jules Deschênes recommended "no prosecution should be started against Helmut Oberlander" because German investigators failed to prove Oberlander took part in any crimes.</p>  <p>Instead, it recommended he be stripped of his Canadian citizenship because he did not divulge his membership in the SS and the <em>Einsatzgruppen </em>to immigration officials.</p>  <p>Ten years later, the news of Oberlander's past became public when Canada started proceedings to remove him. His Canadian citizenship would be revoked four times after 2000. Three times it was overturned by the Federal Court of Appeal, but his final appeal was quashed in 2019.</p>  <div><span><ul class="similarLinks"><li class="similarListItem"><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/oberlander-immigration-stay-1.5955864" class="similarLink" data-contentid flag text="Lawyer for ex-Nazi interpreter Helmut Oberlander files motion to permanently end deportation proceedings"><span class="similarLinkText">Lawyer for ex-Nazi interpreter Helmut Oberlander files motion to permanently end deportation proceedings</span></a></li></ul></span><span><ul class="similarLinks"><li class="similarListItem"><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/helmut-oberlander-nazi-supreme-court-1.5385268" class="similarLink" data-contentid flag text="Supreme Court rejects appeal from ex-Nazi interpreter, clearing way for deportation"><span class="similarLinkText">Supreme Court rejects appeal from ex-Nazi interpreter, clearing way for deportation</span></a></li></ul></span></div>  <p>Now 97, Oberlander is awaiting an immigration hearing, which has been delayed because of complications around COVID-19 and a hearing disability that prevented him from fully communicating with his lawyer.</p>  <p>On Thursday, Oberlander's lawyer, Ronald Poulton, filed a motion to permanently stay the proceedings against his client, alleging he had new evidence the government withheld important evidence.</p>  <ul>   <li><strong><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/oberlander-immigration-stay-1.5955864">Lawyer for ex-Nazi interpreter Helmut Oberlander files motion to permanently end deportation proceedings</a></strong></li>  </ul>  <p>In a statement, Canada Border Services, which handles deportation matters, said it cannot comment on matters before the courts, but added that it places the highest priority on removal cases involving national security, organized crime and crimes against humanity.</p>  <p>It's now up to a judge to consider the motion.

How could this be? How could there be someone who was involved? What is Canada doing?" said Danzinger, who is originally from Toronto. "How do you answer such a thing?"</p>  <p>Danzinger came to Rostov-on-Don 12 years ago, attracted by the challenge of helping rebuild its Jewish community, which was almost completely wiped out during the Second World War.

"He was blind, I guess? Well, I think for this, too, he should be punished. But not deportation. This is not a real punishment."</p>  <p>Rozina said even if authorities put him in jail for a month or two, "that will truly be a punishment for a person of 97 years. He will have no freedom.

It's not about punishment. Justice just means that someone has to be held accountable for something he did," Danzinger said.</p>  <p>As the community watches Canada to see what it decides to do with Oberlander, Rostov's focus is also drawn inward on healing and rebuilding its once-robust Jewish culture, with help from their Toronto rabbi.</p>  <p>Danzinger leads marches of remembrance, and runs an active social media profile that focuses on outreach and education. His efforts are paying off in a city that once had 13 synagogues. </p>  <p>Danzinger has seen a shift as people who were once afraid to identify as Jews are openly embracing it. He said many families felt "we're Jewish, but let's not discuss it. Let's not practise. Let's not participate [in the community]." </p>  <p>But now, he said, "Jews are coming out.
