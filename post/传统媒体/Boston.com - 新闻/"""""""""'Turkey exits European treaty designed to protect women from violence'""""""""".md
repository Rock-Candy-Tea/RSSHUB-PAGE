They see that as a threat to Turkish families. Hate speech has been on the rise in Turkey, including from Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu, who described LGBT people as "perverts" in a tweet. Erdogan has rejected their existence altogether.</p>  <h2>Exit prompts protests</h2>  <p>Women's groups and their allies who have been protesting to keep the convention intact immediately called for demonstrations across the country on Saturday under the slogan, "Withdraw the decision, implement the treaty." They said their years-long struggle would not be erased in one night.</p>  <p>"We were struggling every day so the Istanbul Convention would be implemented and women would live. We now hear that the Istanbul Convention has been completely repealed," said Dilan Akyuz, 30, who joined other women demonstrating in Istanbul. "We are very angry today. We can no longer bear even one death of a woman. We do not have any tolerance for this."</p>  <p>Rights groups say violence against and killing of women are on the rise in Turkey, but the interior minister called that a "complete lie" on Saturday.</p>  <div><span><figure class="imageMedia image full"><div class="placeholder"><div class="placeholderImage" style="padding-bottom:66.61%"></div><img loading="lazy" alt srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5958012.1616277808!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/police-scuffle-with-protesters-in-istanbul-on-march-20-2021.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5958012.1616277808!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/police-scuffle-with-protesters-in-istanbul-on-march-20-2021.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5958012.1616277808!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/police-scuffle-with-protesters-in-istanbul-on-march-20-2021.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5958012.1616277808!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/police-scuffle-with-protesters-in-istanbul-on-march-20-2021.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5958012.1616277808!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/police-scuffle-with-protesters-in-istanbul-on-march-20-2021.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5958012.1616277808!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/police-scuffle-with-protesters-in-istanbul-on-march-20-2021.jpg" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></div><figcaption class="image-caption">Police officers scuffle with protesters during a rally in Istanbul on Saturday.<!-- --> <!-- -->(Emrah Gurel/The Associated Press)</figcaption></figure></span></div>  <p>A total of 77 women have been killed since the start of the year, according to the We Will Stop Femicide Platform. Some 409 women were killed in 2020, with dozens found dead under suspicious circumstances, according to the group.</p>  <p>Numerous women's rights groups slammed the decision. Advocacy group Women's Coalition Turkey said the withdrawal from a human rights agreement was a first in Turkey. "It is clear that this decision will further encourage the murderers of women, harassers, rapists," their statement said.</p>  <h2>Government claims commitment to issue</h2>  <p>Turkey's justice minister said the government was committed to combating violence against women.</p>  <p>"We continue to protect our people's honour, the family and our social fabric with determination," Justice Minister Abdulhamit Gul tweeted.</p>  <p>Erdogan has repeatedly stressed the "holiness" of the family and called on women to have three children. His communications director, Fahrettin Altun, said the government's motto is "Powerful Families, Powerful Society."</p>  <div><span><figure class="imageMedia image full"><div class="placeholder"><div class="placeholderImage" style="padding-bottom:66.61%"></div><img loading="lazy" alt srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5957827.1616260354!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/turkish-president-recep-tayyip-erdogan-in-the-turkish-legislature.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5957827.1616260354!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/turkish-president-recep-tayyip-erdogan-in-the-turkish-legislature.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5957827.1616260354!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/turkish-president-recep-tayyip-erdogan-in-the-turkish-legislature.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5957827.1616260354!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/turkish-president-recep-tayyip-erdogan-in-the-turkish-legislature.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5957827.1616260354!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/turkish-president-recep-tayyip-erdogan-in-the-turkish-legislature.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5957827.1616260354!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/turkish-president-recep-tayyip-erdogan-in-the-turkish-legislature.jpg" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></div><figcaption class="image-caption">Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, shown in February, issued a decree annulling Turkey's ratification of the Istanbul Convention. <!-- --> <!-- -->(Adem Altan/AFP/Getty Images)</figcaption></figure></span></div>  <p>Many women suffer physical or sexual violence at the hands of their husbands or partners, but up-to-date official statistics are unavailable. The Istanbul Convention requires states to collect data.</p>  <p>More than 1,000 women and allies gathered in Istanbul, wearing masks and holding banners. There was a heavy police presence in the area, and the demonstration ended without serious skirmishes.</p>  <p>They shouted pro-LGBT slogans and called for Erdogan's resignation. They cheered as a woman speaking through a megaphone said, "You cannot close up millions of women in their homes. You cannot erase them from the streets and the squares."</p>  <p>"As women, we now think that the withdrawal is a direct attack on women's rights and a direct attack on the rights of modern young women, in particular," Ebru Batur, 21-year-old demonstrator, said. "This of course makes us feel insecure and like our rights are appropriated."</p>  <h2>Turkey signed on first</h2>  <p>Turkey — which applied to join the European Union in 1987 but is not yet a member — was the first country to sign the Council of Europe's "Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence" at a committee of ministers meeting in Istanbul in 2011. The law came into force in 2014, and Turkey's constitution says international agreements have the force of law.</p>  <p>Some lawyers claimed Saturday that the treaty is still active, arguing the president cannot withdraw from it without the approval of parliament, which ratified the Istanbul Convention in 2012.</p>  <div><span><figure class="imageMedia image full"><div class="placeholder"><div class="placeholderImage" style="padding-bottom:66.61%"></div><img loading="lazy" alt srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5957991.1616274541!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/protesters-in-istanbul-on-march-20-2021.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5957991.1616274541!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/protesters-in-istanbul-on-march-20-2021.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5957991.1616274541!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/protesters-in-istanbul-on-march-20-2021.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5957991.1616274541!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/protesters-in-istanbul-on-march-20-2021.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5957991.1616274541!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/protesters-in-istanbul-on-march-20-2021.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5957991.1616274541!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/protesters-in-istanbul-on-march-20-2021.jpg" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></div><figcaption class="image-caption">Protesters gather during a rally in Istanbul on Saturday.<!-- --> <!-- -->(Emrah Gurel/The Associated Press)</figcaption></figure></span></div>  <p>But Erdogan gained sweeping powers with <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/turkey-elections-1.4720065">his re-election in 2018</a>, setting in motion Turkey changing from a parliamentary system of government to an executive presidency.</p>  <p>The justice minister wrote on Twitter that while parliament approves treaties that the executive branch puts into effect, the executive also has the authority to withdraw from them.</p>  <p>Women lawmakers from Turkey's main opposition party said they will not recognize the decree and called it another "coup" on parliament, which had unanimously accepted the treaty, and a usurpation of the rights of 42 million women.</p>  <h2>Germany, France criticize withdrawal</h2>  <p>Germany's Foreign Ministry joined the criticism, saying "withdrawal from the Istanbul Convention is a wrong signal for Europe, but especially for the women of Turkey."</p>  <p>"Only a few weeks ago, President Erdogan introduced an action plan for human rights which also includes the fight against domestic violence and violence against women," the German ministry said in a statement.
