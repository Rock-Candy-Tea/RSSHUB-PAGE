"The Canadian Red Cross has been authorized to approve travel into New Brunswick for end-of-life visits with an immediate family member." </p>  <p>Those granted permits must still comply with <a href="https://www2.gnb.ca/content/dam/gnb/Departments/eco-bce/Promo/covid-19/who_needs_to_self-isolate-e.pdf" target="_blank">self-isolation guidelines</a>, but if they "need to attend a funeral, burial or end-of-life visit in a hospital, hospice or nursing home prior to completing 14 days of self-isolation, [they] must first test negative for COVID-19 on the fifth day of self-isolation."</p>  <p>After a negative result, "you may only leave your place of self-isolation as required for an end-of-life visit or to attend a funeral or burial service in compliance with public health guidelines. If you need to visit your family member in home for end-of-life visit prior to completing 14 days of self-isolation, strict protocols for these visits will be provided to you by Red Cross staff."</p>  <h2>Sad and angry</h2>  <p>"Apparently the new normal allows me to visit my father on his death bed or in a coffin but not while there is a spark of life still left in him," Pitre wrote on Facebook.</p>  <p>In an interview with Radio-Canada, he said he's sad, frustrated and angry.</p>  <p>"I can drive from Gatineau in nine hours to Pointe-à-la-Croix, but I can't drive the last five minutes to get to my parents' house. I don't understand the logic. It just floors me," he said.</p>  <p>Pointe-à-la-Croix is in eastern Quebec on the Restigouche River, across from Campbellton.</p>  <p>On Thursday, during the New Brunswick government's live-streamed COVID-19 update, Health Minister Dorothy Shephard was asked about whether there's any way for Pitre to visit his father.</p>  <p>"As of today, I'm not thinking that there's a path, a clear path, here," she said.</p>  <p>Shephard encouraged him to follow the process that's in place and submit an application, "and I'm sure that as soon as we can make a positive answer, we will."</p>  <p>She said it's "heartbreaking," but the rules are in place to protect the public.</p></span></div>
