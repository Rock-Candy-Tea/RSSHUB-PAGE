Because the outbreak was not widespread in China, a relatively small proportion of the population acquired immunity through past infection, he said. Mainland China has reported 90,099 cases during the pandemic.</p>  <p>The relatively low rate of vaccination in China was one reason Feng cited for maintaining the current measures for overseas arrivals.
