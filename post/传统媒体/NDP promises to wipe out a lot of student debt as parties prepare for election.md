He said he would also close tax loopholes.</p>  <p>"Young people are making student loan payments the size of mortgage payments, spending years under crushing debt not able to get ahead. And the COVID-19 pandemic only made matters worse," Singh said in a media release.</p>  <p>Singh announced the campaign plank at the party's virtual youth convention Saturday. Opposition parties have <u><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/ndp-campaign-debt-repays-pandemic-1.5894840" target="_blank">said they are preparing</a></u> for the governing Liberals to trigger an election in the near future. Speaking to French media earlier this month, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau <u><a href="https://www.ledevoir.com/politique/canada/596641/justin-trudeau-n-ecarte-pas-des-elections-federales-anticipees?utm_term=Autofeed&utm_campaign=Autopost&utm_medium=Social&utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1615401083" target="_blank">would not rule out</a></u> an early election.</p>  <p>Singh said young people have been among those hardest-hit by the pandemic's economic impact. Many are paying thousands of dollars in tuition for classes that are no longer being held in person.</p>  <p>Singh accused the Liberals of "profiting off the backs of young people."</p>  <p>The party says it remains committed to working with provinces and territories to eventually make post-secondary education tuition-free for Canadians.</p>  <p>Today's announcement goes further than Singh's 2019 election campaign pledge. During that campaign, Singh said an NDP government would eliminate all existing and future interest charged on federal student loans and work with provinces and territories to cap and reduce tuition fees.</p>  <p>The Parliamentary Budget Officer estimated the cost of those promises would rise to as much as $598 million annually by 2030.</p>  <div><span><ul class="similarLinks"><li class="similarListItem"><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/grenier-ndp-rise-1.5933907" class="similarLink" data-contentid flag="Analysis" text="Singh's NDP could gain a little — and lose a lot — in a spring election"><div class="label flag"><span class="labelText external">Analysis</span></div><span class="similarLinkText">Singh's NDP could gain a little — and lose a lot — in a spring election</span></a></li></ul></span><span><ul class="similarLinks"><li class="similarListItem"><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/minority-government-election-timing-pandemic-1.5929690" class="similarLink" data-contentid flag="Analysis" text="Singh and the NDP may prop up the Liberals — but that doesn't mean we'll avoid a pandemic election"><div class="label flag"><span class="labelText external">Analysis</span></div><span class="similarLinkText">Singh and the NDP may prop up the Liberals — but that doesn't mean we'll avoid a pandemic election</span></a></li></ul></span><span><ul class="similarLinks"><li class="similarListItem"><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/ndp-unveils-small-business-plan-1.5933764" class="similarLink" data-contentid flag text="Federal NDP unveils election-style promises to support small businesses during pandemic"><span class="similarLinkText">Federal NDP unveils election-style promises to support small businesses during pandemic</span></a></li></ul></span><span><ul class="similarLinks"><li class="similarListItem"><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/radio/frontburner/election-speculation-grips-ottawa-1.5946619" class="similarLink" data-contentid flag="FRONT BURNER" text="Election speculation grips Ottawa"><div class="label flag"><span class="labelText external">FRONT BURNER</span></div><span class="similarLinkText">Election speculation grips Ottawa</span></a></li></ul></span></div>  <p>The other parties made promises to students as well. Those measures are archived <u><a href="https://newsinteractives.cbc.ca/elections/federal/2019/party-platforms/" target="_blank">here</a></u> in the education section of the CBC's 2019 platform tracker.</p>  <p>A spokesperson for Employment Minister Carla Qualtrough provided a list of measures the government has either implemented or says it is working toward. They include doubling student grants and eliminating interest on federal student loans this year.</p>  <p>"We know students and young Canadians are still facing challenges, and we will continue to do what it takes to be there to support students and help them get through these challenging times," the minister's press secretary, Marielle Hossack, said in a media statement.</p>  <p>As part of their pandemic relief, the governing Liberals <u><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/covid-19-coronavirus-pandemic-student-loans-1.5502179" target="_blank">suspended student loan </a></u>repayments. But that financial break ended in September and interest payments resumed in October.</p>  <p>Today's NDP youth convention takes place three weeks before the party's national convention. These conventions allow the party's membership to change the party's constitution, policies and leadership.</p></span></div>
