      <p>The Democrat-media complex reserves a special scorn for politicians who burst their bubbles. So little wonder that cabal is dumping so hard this week on Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell. How dare he speak truth to filibuster nonsense?</p>
      <p>The cognoscenti has spent years laying the groundwork for the death of that Senate rule, which requires 60 votes to pass most legislation. Central to the argument is that the filibuster is the reason we have a “broken” Senate. Get rid of it, and legislation—nay, democracy!—will flow.</p>

      <p>Mr. McConnell’s offense was his Tuesday speech explaining why this has it completely backward. To blow up the filibuster—and in the process infuriate 50 “minority” senators—would destroy the one thing that <em>does </em>in fact make the Senate function: comity. Democrats wouldn’t speed up their agenda; they would bury it. The Senate, Mr. McConnell said, would be a “100-car pileup—nothing moving.”</p>
      <p>Trust him. As Majority Leader
      
      Chuck Schumer
      well knows, there are 44 standing rules of the Senate; the filibuster is but one. A Congressional Research Service report notes that most are designed to enhance “the rights of individual senators” at the expense of “the powers of the majority.” To the extent the Senate functions at all, the report notes repeatedly, it is only because senators willingly relinquish those prerogatives. Mr. McConnell on Tuesday described a world in which they don’t, which he called a “scorched-earth Senate.” </p>
      <p>It’s a world without “unanimous consent,” in which a senator asks all 99 colleagues to give up their right to object to a proposal. Senate leaders rely on unanimous consent dozens of a times a day. You need consent to open the Senate before noon, to dispense with the reading of the preceding day’s journal, to move to business, to avoid reading out loud the text of every amendment and resolution, to avoid roll call votes. The Senate functions because most consent requests are granted.</p>
      
      <p>When they aren’t? It takes only one Republican to object to a request but a majority to overcome most objections. Mr. Schumer might at any time need all 50 of his members—and the vice president—on the floor to move things along. Likewise to override a flow of “points of order.” All day, every day. Republicans could flit in and out, and it would only take a handful of members to force roll calls for all these votes, eating up more hours. Democratic senators and

      would essentially live at the Capitol, constantly on call. If even one was absent at a crucial moment, the Senate would essentially shut down.</p>

      <p>Now add in “quorum” calls. Any senator can question, pretty much any time, whether the Senate truly has 51 senators on the floor (the vice president doesn’t count). It’s unclear whether a lone Republican could issue a quorum call, flee and stymie Senate business until the sergeant of arms rounded him back up. But even if that lone Republican stayed, quorum calls would eat up hours. The Senate secretary is required in each case to call the roll, of all 100 senators. Anyone who has ever watched C-Span 2 knows this takes ages.</p>
      <p>There are even more creative ideas, but these tools alone would be enough to paralyze the institution. The Senate convenes. Quorum call. The presiding officer asks for consent to forgo reading yesterday’s journal. Republicans object. Roll call vote. The officer asks for consent to speed through “morning business.” Republicans object. Democrats move to get on an issue. Point of order. Roll-call vote. Quorum call. Republicans object to the motion. Roll-call vote. A speech. Quorum call. Etc., and so on, until adjournment.</p>
      <p>Democrats may be betting that moderate Republicans would be uncomfortable exercising these tactics, especially in matters of more routine business. Then again, it takes only <em>one </em>Republican to object or to issue quorum calls. And don’t underestimate how bitter even moderate GOP members would be if their “bipartisan” friends across the aisle join the effort to dismantle minority rights.</p>
      
      <p>The left could demand Senate Democrats kill more rules, stripping that individual power. But members willing to kill a rule primarily to enhance the current majority’s power will be far less keen to kill rules that shred their own rights. And even if West Virginia’s
      
      Joe Manchin
      or Arizona’s Kyrsten Sinema could be successfully pummeled into axing the filibuster, would they really be willing to transform the Senate completely? To divest it systematically of every members’ right, privilege and prerogative that has made the institution unique?</p>
      <p>The notion that killing the filibuster will make the Senate “work” is pure partisan fantasy. Mr. McConnell’s speech was designed to remind Democratic moderates that killing the rule won’t just destroy the rights of the minority, it will destroy what function still exists in the Senate. </p>
      <p>The filibuster isn’t the problem, and the Senate isn’t “broken.” All that stands in the way of legislation is a Democratic majority unwilling to compromise on any aspect of a radical agenda.</p>
