      <p>It means more than nothing that President Biden recently could not come up with the name of the defense secretary standing behind him or even the Pentagon—“the guy who runs that outfit over there.” But do not confuse these lapses with the notion that Mr. Biden is unskilled in the art of political magic. He fooled me—getting nearly $2 trillion of long-term spending passed under the pretense of a Covid crisis that is fading. He’s taking a victory-lap tour now, and why not? He earned it. </p>
       <p>We’ve said more than once here that the pivotal event of the 2020 Democratic contest was
      
      Rep. Jim Clyburn’s
      endorsement of Mr. Biden before the South Carolina primary. We seconded the conventional wisdom that Mr. Clyburn concluded
      
      Sen. Bernie Sanders
      was too far left to win the general election against
      <a href="https://www.wsj.com/topics/person/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a>.
      
      Mr. Clyburn saw that success ran through a “moderate” Mr. Biden. </p>

      <p>He was right. Where we were wrong—and for this flight from cynicism, an apology is in order—was in thinking Mr. Clyburn disagreed with Mr. Sanders’s politics. </p>
      <p>Still, many voters believed the Biden campaign was, as advertised, about rediscovering “normalcy.” It turns out the Biden presidency isn’t about anything very normal. Now it’s about “going big,” despite his minimalist election mandate. </p>
      <p>Going big began with “Covid relief,” a euphemism to bury the bill’s non-Covid goals, such as rolling back
      
      Bill Clinton’s
      landmark welfare-towork reform law. The work part is being eliminated. </p>
      
      <p>Recall as well how last July many thought Mr. Biden was throwing a sop to the party’s defeated progressives when he tweeted that his administration “won’t just rebuild this nation—we’ll transform it.” In reply, Mr. Sanders said Mr. Biden could be “the most progressive president” since
      
      Franklin Roosevelt.
      Cynics snickered. Wrong again. </p>
      <p>Mr. Trump was fond of saying the Democratic establishment “rigged” the 2016 election against Bernie to favor
      
      Hillary Clinton.
      We now see that while Mr. Trump plays politics day by day, Mr. Sanders plays long ball. Mr. Trump lost Georgia and retired to Mar-a-Lago. Mr. Sanders lost South Carolina and won the presidency. </p>
      <p>Much as I hate to eat more crow, a secondary winner in 2020 needs to be acknowledged:
      
      Sen. Elizabeth Warren.
      Her campaign was also an accurate predictor of what the “normal” Biden presidency would in fact become. </p>
      <p>Sen. Warren’s contribution to what our politics have become was to promote her ideas in the language of the political apocalypse, calling out one dire crisis after another. She outranted even Mr. Sanders in describing America as a failed nation requiring radical solutions. </p>

      <p>During the campaign, conventional wisdom discounted the chances that she or Mr. Sanders could win with the claim that the U.S. was in a sea-to-shining-sea state of catastrophe. Instead, the argument went, the U.S. electorate remains fundamentally center-left to center-right and wants to be governed that way. But when 10 Republican senators visited Mr. Biden in the Oval Office to offer center-right adjustments to his Covid bill, he showed them the door. </p>
      
      <p>So less than 100 days into the Biden presidency, a question: Mr. Biden’s centrist or “normal” campaign pitch may have put him in the White House. But is the Sanders-Warren political model—threaten the country repeatedly with apocalyptic disasters if “we don’t act”—the way you win at governing in our time? </p>
      <p>Mr. Biden promoted his spending bill by saying, falsely, that America’s Covid economic crisis is “not getting better; it’s deepening.” But it <em>was </em>getting better. Days after the bill passed, a headline in the Journal noted: “Factories Struggle to Meet Demand.” Amazing how Mr. Biden has re-created the miracle of the loaves and the fishes. Still, raising the stakes to apocalyptic levels worked. </p>
      <p>The Sanders-Warren over-the-top crisis rhetoric will now be deployed daily to sell the rest of the party’s agenda. </p>
      <p>The Biden climate bill’s estimated cost: $2 trillion, naturally. We have a “narrow moment,” Mr. Biden says, to “avoid the most catastrophic impacts of this crisis.” </p>
      
      <p>Nor will we be allowed to forget we’re also in a “systemic racism” crisis that emerged this past year. Some 55 years after passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, Democrats are selling H.R.1 “to overcome rampant voter suppression.” Mr. Clyburn, the godfather of normalcy, says the Senate filibuster shouldn’t apply to H.R.1 because it is “voting right” legislation. </p>
      <p>And if a real crisis happens, as with Central Americans flooding through the southern border, euphemize it as someone else’s mess. </p>
      <p>Somebody inside the Biden team recognized that normalcy wins elections, but sober realism doesn’t move legislation or public enthusiasm. The new reality may be that in an era of social media, the most relevant metric is having one’s ever-at-risk heart in the right place. That means turning every political issue into a referendum on catastrophe. So far, smiling through the apocalypse seems to be working for Mr. Biden.</p>
