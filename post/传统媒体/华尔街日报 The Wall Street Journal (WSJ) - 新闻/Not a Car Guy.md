      <p>The Washington custom at least through the Obama-Biden era was to   pretend that “infrastructure” bills would fund critically needed roads and bridges. The promise was that big spending on “shovel-ready” projects would both create jobs and meet transportation needs. Taxpayers only learned long after the passage of the 2009 stimulus plan that it didn’t create the promised jobs, that only about 10% of the money went to infrastructure, and that very few projects were shovel-ready. Now Washington has a new custom and the Biden-Harris administration isn’t even bothering to pretend.  </p>
       <p>While Team Biden mulls how many trillions of dollars to propose spending on its “infrastructure” plan and whose taxes should rise to finance it, the administration has already made an important decision. The goal is not to give Americans a faster, smoother, safer drive to work. </p>

      <blockquote>Transportation Secretary
      
      Pete Buttigieg
      said Thursday that an infrastructure plan expected soon from President
      <a href="https://www.wsj.com/topics/person/joe-biden">Joe Biden</a>
      
      will offer a “once in a century” opportunity to remake transportation in the United States, where cars and highways are no longer king.</blockquote> <blockquote>Speaking at the Austin, Texas-based South by Southwest conference, which is being held virtually this year, Buttigieg compared the new possibility to the creation of an interstate highway under President
      
      Dwight Eisenhower
      in the 1950s and a transcontinental railroad under President
      
      Abraham Lincoln
      a century before that.</blockquote> <blockquote>“We start with something unglamorous, which is fixing and improving what we’re already got — there’s been a trillion dollar backlog just in the roads and bridges we already have,” he said. “But I’ll add there are some things that need to be reduced ... sometimes roads need to go on a diet.”</blockquote> <p>Perhaps this is no surprise to those who have been paying attention to the climate obsessions of the modern Democratic Party. But Mr. Buttigieg is not just calling for cars to be electric and powered by green energy. The former mayor of South Bend, Ind., seems to be arguing that even a massive federal infrastructure bill should result in no net increase in the most popular form of infrastructure. The AP’s Ms. Yen has more:</p>
      <blockquote>“The design choices we make, how fast cars move, whether there’s bike lanes and sidewalks ... green space even, all of this is part of that view,” Buttigieg said. “Sometimes we do need to add a road or widen one. Just as often, I think we need to subtract.”</blockquote> <p>This is bound to make more than a few taxpayers wonder why Congress needs to enact another spending bill at all. After the $1.9 trillion “Covid relief” plan that was largely unrelated to the treatment of Covid, will Washington now enact a multitrillion-dollar infrastructure plan that is largely unrelated to infrastructure? </p>
      
      <p>When the Biden administration gets around to negotiating with Congress on appropriations for the Pentagon, let’s hope they manage to include a few dollars for national defense. </p>

      <p><strong>Can’t Say We Weren’t Warned</strong><br>

Meanwhile back home in Indiana, Mr. Buttigieg’s successor as mayor of South Bend is facing a particular challenge. Max Lewis of WSBT <a href="https://wsbt.com/news/local/city-of-south-bend-announces-10-year-street-repair-plan" target="_blank" class="icon none">reported</a> last month:</p>
      <blockquote>South Bend’s mayor says fixing the city’s streets is going to be a long process. He announced a 10-year improvement plan today to rebuild that crumbling infrastructure.</blockquote> <blockquote>... Mayor James Mueller said in the past, the focus has been on the city’s major thoroughfares. This time, they’re focusing on residential streets that have long been overlooked.</blockquote> <blockquote>A 10-year rebuilding plan will fix streets that are literally falling apart.</blockquote> <p>“This is a point of consternation with our residents,” said Mr. Mueller. </p>

      <p><strong>And Now the Good News from Indiana</strong></p>
      <p>March Madness is under way and for Covid-related reasons the NCAA men’s basketball tournament is happening entirely within the borders of Indiana. Fortunately the state’s “cathedral of basketball” is among the venues.</p>
      <p>Paul Sullivan <a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/college/ct-prem-loyola-ramblers-ncaa-tournament-hinkle-fieldhouse-20210318-zpk5j3a53jdybhs7lg63xfvbv4-story.html" target="_blank" class="icon none">writes</a> in the Chicago Tribune about historic Hinkle Fieldhouse:</p>
      
      <blockquote>It opened in 1928 on the Butler University campus as the Butler Fieldhouse and was renamed after longtime Bulldogs coach and athletic director Paul “Tony” Hinkle in 1966.</blockquote> <blockquote>... It’s large glass windows let in the late-winter sun for afternoon games, giving Hinkle a nostalgic feel that’s difficult to replicate in most modern-day arenas...</blockquote> <blockquote>Perhaps the most famous game in the Fieldhouse’s long history was the Indiana state championship game between Muncie Central and tiny Milan High School in 1954. Milan’s Bobby Plump hit the game-winning shot in one of the biggest upsets in Indiana high school basketball history, providing the inspiration for “Hoosiers,” with the Jimmy Chitwood character in the Plump role.</blockquote> <p>The filming of the movie’s fictional championship game also occurred at Hinkle. “And yes, the rim measures 10 feet from the floor,” <a href="https://www.indystar.com/story/sports/college/butler/2021/03/12/march-madness-2021-venues-hinkle-fieldhouse-ncaa-tournament-basketball-indianapolis/4642024001/" target="_blank" class="icon none">report</a> Matthew Glenesk and David Woods in the Indianapolis Star. </p>
