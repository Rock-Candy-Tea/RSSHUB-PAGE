      <p>When I was growing up in New Jersey, Newark was always a pass-through city—as in: quickly pass through the airport, train station, highway. Newark consistently shows up on high-crime, corruption and “murder capital” lists. Many have tried to turn it around.</p>
      <p>I met
      
      Cory Booker
      when he ran for mayor in 2006. This was before he became Sen. Spartacus. I don’t like giving money to politicians—it only encourages them—but I offered advice. Given Newark’s international airport, thriving seaport, Amtrak station, interstate highways, proximity to pharma and chemical manufacturers and refineries while being within shouting distance of Wall Street, I said he should demand an exemption from federal and state taxes for companies that locate in Newark and increase hiring. A Booker aide interrupted: “I don’t think we can propose cutting taxes. It won’t look good.” </p>
       <p>As mayor, Mr. Booker instead raised $100 million from Facebook CEO
      <a href="https://www.wsj.com/topics/person/mark-zuckerberg">Mark Zuckerberg</a>
      
      for Newark schools—<a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/05/19/schooled" target="_blank" class="icon none">a deal considered a dud</a> once the dust settled. The <a href="https://www.macrotrends.net/cities/us/nj/newark/crime-rate-statistics#:~:text=The%20Newark%20NJ%20crime%20rate,a%2013.06%%20decline%20from%202014." target="_blank" class="icon none">crime rate</a> in Newark rose during his seven-year tenure, 2006-13, though the financial crisis didn’t help. Government failed again.</p>

      <p>It doesn’t have to be that way. I met
      
      Don Katz
      soon after he founded audiobook company Audible in 1995—I even had one of their <a href="https://images.ctfassets.net/3sa0209epr53/LxcTUMWdYiaWOYMKMeeaG/69fcb7a616d5e55b79c5dda4fda3cc12/audible-history-1997-mobile_player.jpg" target="_blank" class="icon none">MobilePlayer devices</a>. In 2007 Mr. Katz moved the 125-person company from the Willowbrook Mall in Wayne, N.J., to downtown Newark, and he did it without government-proffered incentives. Audible hires lots of area talent for readings, and the fastest train is 13 minutes from Manhattan. Though
            <a href="https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/AMZN" class="company-name">Amazon</a>
      bought the company in 2008, Audible is still in Newark, now with 1,700 employees plus contractors, and it is helping <a href="https://www.njspotlight.com/video/american-cities-rebuilding-a-look-inside-audible/" target="_blank" class="icon none">turn things around</a>.</p>
      <p>Mr. Katz told me he’s always disdained companies and executives who “give money away but don’t apply the same inputs and outputs as they do with their business.” More spray and pray, they rarely measure effectiveness. That’s also true of government.</p>
      
      <p>Instead, Mr. Katz strongly believes there are “scalable models that are good for business and good for society.” His favorite is “live local.” He began to pay employees $500 after tax for monthly rent if they moved into Newark. People called him crazy. He says he noticed “measurable productivity just from walking to work”—pre-Covid, anyway—plus, “young professionals want to be part of an urban recovery.”</p>
      <p>Tech companies hire lots of coders, but how does that help current residents? Newark, whose population is half black and one-third Hispanic, needs jobs. So Mr. Katz set up the Audible Interns program. He decided to toss “nepotism internships” and instead require paid interns to be from Newark, to “give people a chance.” Many were without homes, some from the Covenant House, a residence for abused and neglected youth; Mr. Katz describes them as “in the vortex of single-parent, welfare existence.” These were not MIT engineers but “people without high school or college degrees for these really high-tech jobs. I wanted to expose them to the vocabulary of the workplace.” That was a big bet.</p>
      <p>Audible looks for “gregarious and bright” versus credentialed and experienced. An Audible Scholars program offers aid and guaranteed jobs at summer breaks for those who go on to college. Mr. Katz says the model works: Graduates of the program now make up 10% of Audible’ employees. Most pick up the technology quickly and become productive, “more than paying for their cost of onboarding.”</p>
      <p>To scale the model, in 2015 Mr. Katz started Newark Venture Partners, which has funded 93 companies—“little Audibles”—chosen from more than 8,000 that applied. Investors in the fund are mainly Audible and other corporations that provide coaching to entrepreneurs. Public money makes up less than 5% of the funding, Mr. Katz says. One interesting investment is MoCaFi, a Newark-based financial platform for underbanked communities. And yes, my tax plan for Mr. Booker was probably wrong—small, innovative companies don’t pay corporate taxes, at least not yet.</p>
      
      <p>When the pandemic hit, Newark went into survival mode. Mr. Katz quickly set up Newark Working Kitchens to help save restaurants. Using much of Audible’s $10 million in suddenly unused food-and-travel budget, the group hired local restaurants to make 200 meals a day each and then used Audible vans, volunteers and logistics code to deliver meals to the homeless, public schools and homes without food. It worked so well—750,000 meals and counting—that the program just received $2 million from the New Jersey Economic Development Authority. Public funding for a proven private program: That’s a smart model.</p>
      <p>Big government programs often fail. San Francisco is spending $16.1 million on “safe sleeping villages” containing a total of 262 <a href="https://ktla.com/news/california/san-francisco-paying-16-1-million-for-people-living-in-tent-camps-as-city-struggles-with-swelling-homeless-population/" target="_blank" class="icon none">tents for the homeless</a>. That’s $61,000 each, approaching the median individual income in San Francisco, yet they still live in tents. One company can’t turn around a city, but maybe Don Katz and Audible can be a model for private companies to change the trajectory of other pass-through cities.</p>
