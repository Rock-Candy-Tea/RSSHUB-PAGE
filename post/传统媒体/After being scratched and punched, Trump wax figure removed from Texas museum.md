Even after the statue was moved to the lobby — where attendants could see it — the jabs and scratches did not stop, according to the San Antonio Express-News, which reported on the removal of the figure.</p> </div></div> <div data-type="text" class="crd clln--it"> <div class=" crd--cnt "> <p class data-item-type="depthscroll" data-item-id="depth_scroll_middle" data-item-number="middle"> Trump’s figure was on display in a city that voted decidedly blue in the last election, in a state that stands out as a Republican stronghold.</p> </div></div> <div data-type="text" class="crd clln--it"> <div class=" crd--cnt "> <p class> The figure, which sported the former president’s signature red tie and cuff links, was part of a rotating display at the museum, Smagala-Potts said. A wax figure of President Joe Biden is also in the works.</p> </div></div> <div data-type="text" class="crd clln--it"> <div class=" crd--cnt "> <p class> At attractions with wax figures, bad news coverage can lead to removing a figure or placing it in a less prominent position.</p> </div></div>  <div data-type="text" class="crd clln--it"> <div class=" crd--cnt "> <p class> When Matt Lauer, a former “Today” show anchor, was accused of sexual harassment in 2017, his likeness was removed from Madame Tussauds in New York City. By contrast, an actor’s recent Oscar win might warrant moving a wax figure to a more visible spot.</p> </div></div> <div data-type="text" class="crd clln--it"> <div class=" crd--cnt "> <p class> With a $24.99 admission fee, the San Antonio site has more than 200 life-size figures on display. Some are available for visitors to take selfies with, including President Vladimir Putin of Russia; North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong Un; and actor Dwayne Johnson, known as the Rock.</p> </div></div> <div data-type="text" class="crd clln--it"> <div class=" crd--cnt "> <p class> Smagala-Potts said that rules about touching the figures varied at the company’s locations but that guests were encouraged to take photos with the statues. Damage is often a result of “wear and tear” where selfies are welcome, she said. A visitor might walk too close to or bump into the likes of Miley Cyrus or Lady Gaga, for example.</p> </div></div> <div data-type="text" class="crd clln--it"> <div class=" crd--cnt "> <p class> It takes more than 20 artists more than 800 hours to complete a wax figure, Madame Tussauds said. The process includes more than 200 measurements, which are used to create a metal skeleton and a clay mold for the wax to be poured into. Artists rely on photos if the subject is not available in person.</p> </div></div>  <div data-type="text" class="crd clln--it"> <div class=" crd--cnt "> <p class> The company said all of its figures were about 2% larger than the actual subjects because the wax shrinks. The heads and the bodies are made separately, because it takes more than a month to insert individual strands of human hair into the wax.</p> </div></div> <div data-type="text" class="crd clln--it"> <div class=" crd--cnt "> <p class="stop-here"> Madame Tussauds’ exhibits date back more than 200 years, although the first U.S. location opened in Las Vegas in 1999. Each site has a studio artist to do daily touch-ups and regular maintenance of the figures, said Brittany Williams, a company spokesperson.</p> </div></div> <div data-type="text" class="crd clln--it"> <div class=" crd--cnt "> <p class> “If a hand is held too tightly, or too many guests have run their fingers through the hair of a famous figure, our studio artists have a treasure trove of tools to fully restore the wax figure and place it back in the spotlight,” Williams said.</p> </div></div> <div data-type="text" class="crd clln--it"> <div class=" crd--cnt "> <p class data-item-type="depthscroll" data-item-id="depth_scroll_bottom" data-item-number="bottom"> <i>c.2021 The New York Times Company</i></p> <div class="spaced spaced-md spaced-bottom hddn-mble"></div> <div class="spaced spaced-sm spaced-bottom hddn-dktp hddn-tbl"></div> </div></div> </div>  </div> <div id="f0b6YJJV5Q0Xps" class="pb-async pb-feature"></div> <div id="fQNMYA1V5Q0Xps" class="pb-async pb-feature"></div>  <div class="pb-container"> </div>
