Now, almost a quarter of a century after fleeing the country, he tells the BBC that he plans to marry his American boyfriend.</b></p></div></div><div data-component="text-block" class="ssrcss-uf6wea-RichTextComponentWrapper e1xue1i83"><div class="ssrcss-3z08n3-RichTextContainer e5tfeyi2"><p>Jang Yeong-jin had never found women attractive. But it wasn't until his wedding night, aged 27, that this made his life difficult. </p></div></div><div data-component="text-block" class="ssrcss-uf6wea-RichTextComponentWrapper e1xue1i83"><div class="ssrcss-3z08n3-RichTextContainer e5tfeyi2"><p>Jang felt intensely uncomfortable. "I couldn't lay a finger on my wife," he recalls. Although the couple did eventually consummate their marriage, sex was rare. Four years later - his wife still not pregnant - one of Jang's brothers began to quiz him. Jang admitted he had never been aroused by the opposite sex, and his brother promptly sent him to a doctor.</p></div></div><div data-component="text-block" class="ssrcss-uf6wea-RichTextComponentWrapper e1xue1i83"><div class="ssrcss-3z08n3-RichTextContainer e5tfeyi2"><p>"I went to so many hospitals in North Korea because we thought that I had some sort of physical problem." </p></div></div><div data-component="text-block" class="ssrcss-uf6wea-RichTextComponentWrapper e1xue1i83"><div class="ssrcss-3z08n3-RichTextContainer e5tfeyi2"><p>It never occurred to Jang, or his family, that there could be another reason for his lack of interest. </p></div></div><div data-component="crosshead-block" class="ssrcss-mysbf6-ComponentWrapper-CrossheadComponentWrapper e1xue1i84"><h2 class="ssrcss-qozapo-StyledHeading e1fj1fc10">Medical tests </h2></div><div data-component="text-block" class="ssrcss-uf6wea-RichTextComponentWrapper e1xue1i83"><div class="ssrcss-3z08n3-RichTextContainer e5tfeyi2"><p>"There is no concept of homosexuality in North Korea," he says. If someone is seen running to greet another same sex friend, it's assumed that's just because they have such a close friendship. In fact adults of the same sex often hold hands in the street, he says. "North Korea is a totalitarian society - we have lots of communal life so it's normal for us." </p></div></div><div data-component="text-block" class="ssrcss-uf6wea-RichTextComponentWrapper e1xue1i83"><div class="ssrcss-3z08n3-RichTextContainer e5tfeyi2"><p>Jang now thinks his experience of being misunderstood was by no means unique.</p></div></div><div data-component="text-block" class="ssrcss-uf6wea-RichTextComponentWrapper e1xue1i83"><div class="ssrcss-3z08n3-RichTextContainer e5tfeyi2"><p>At one point, Jang was admitted to hospital for a month of tests and got to know some of the other patients.

A few hours later, Jang found himself creeping out of his own bed and in beside Seoncheol. He was devastated when his sleeping friend didn't so much as stir. </p></div></div><div data-component="text-block" class="ssrcss-uf6wea-RichTextComponentWrapper e1xue1i83"><div class="ssrcss-3z08n3-RichTextContainer e5tfeyi2"><p>"I don't know what I wanted from him exactly - maybe I just wanted him to hug me tight," says Jang.</p></div></div><div data-component="text-block" class="ssrcss-uf6wea-RichTextComponentWrapper e1xue1i83"><div class="ssrcss-3z08n3-RichTextContainer e5tfeyi2"><p>But the moment crystallised his feeling that his life in North Korea had come to an end.</p></div></div><div data-component="image-block" class="ssrcss-18mjolk-ComponentWrapper e1xue1i80"><figure class="ssrcss-2y05cd-StyledFigure e34k3c20"><div class="ssrcss-kwaqyc-StyledFigureContainer e34k3c22"><span class="ssrcss-1iqsg44-Placeholder e16icw910"><span><img alt="Short presentational grey line" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/72FB/production/_112953492__90021446_test_grey_line_new-nc.png 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/72FB/production/_112953492__90021446_test_grey_line_new-nc.png 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/72FB/production/_112953492__90021446_test_grey_line_new-nc.png 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/72FB/production/_112953492__90021446_test_grey_line_new-nc.png 624w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/72FB/production/_112953492__90021446_test_grey_line_new-nc.png 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/72FB/production/_112953492__90021446_test_grey_line_new-nc.png 976w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/72FB/production/_112953492__90021446_test_grey_line_new-nc.png" width="624" height="23" loading="lazy" class="ssrcss-evoj7m-Image ee0ct7c0" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></span></span></div></figure></div><div data-component="text-block" class="ssrcss-uf6wea-RichTextComponentWrapper e1xue1i83"><div class="ssrcss-3z08n3-RichTextContainer e5tfeyi2"><p>Jang arrived in South Korea in April 1997 by crawling across the mine-strewn de-militarized zone (DMZ) that divides the two nations, after his initial route left him stranded in China.
