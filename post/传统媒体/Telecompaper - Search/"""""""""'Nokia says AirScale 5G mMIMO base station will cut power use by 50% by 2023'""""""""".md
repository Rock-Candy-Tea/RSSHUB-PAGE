Equipment vendor Nokia has announced that its AirScale 5G mMIMO Base Station will achieve an average cut in power consumption of 50 percent by 2023, through continuous improvements in software functionalities and new mMIMO product variants based on its latest System on Chips (SoC)s. In recent customer field tests on a live, commercial network, the power consumption of Nokia's 5G mMIMO BTS site was double-digit percentage points lower than that of its nearest competitor.
