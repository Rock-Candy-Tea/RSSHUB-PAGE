United Group has selected Nokia to support its roll-out of a next-generation fibre network across southeast Europe. The group plans to invest over EUR 500 million over the next five years to extend its fibre network into new areas and upgrade existing ones with 10 Gbps-enabled infrastructure based on XGS-PON.
