Nokia said on the occasion of its Capital Markets Day that it expects its comparable operating margin to rise to between 10 percent and 13 percent in 2023, and to grow faster than the market in full-year 2023. It announced three stages toward sustainable, profitable growth and technology leadership, with a "new company purpose" and new ways of working. It reiterates its financial outlook for FY 2021.
