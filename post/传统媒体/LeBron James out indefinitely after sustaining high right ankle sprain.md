The defending NBA champions already are without All-NBA big man Anthony Davis, who has missed 14 consecutive games with a right calf injury and won't play again until April.</p><section id="inread-wrapper-id-101780709"></section>  <p>James was hurt when he rolled his ankle under Solomon Hill, who was called for a foul as he reached awkwardly for a steal. The 36-year-old superstar screamed and fell to the court clutching at his ankle, yet he got up and briefly stayed in the game.</p>  <p>"I haven't necessarily seen him scream and squall like that, probably ever, not even with that groin," said Kyle Kuzma, who was with the Lakers when James missed 17 games with a groin injury two seasons ago. "It had to hurt a little bit, for sure."</p>  <p><em><strong>WATCH | LeBron James suffer injury in¬†Lakers¬†loss to Hawks:</strong></em></p>  <div><span><span class="mediaEmbed"><div class="player-placeholder-ui-container  "><div class="player-placeholder-video-ui" title="LeBron James suffers ankle injury in loss to Hawks" role="button" tabindex="0"><div class="player-placeholder"></div><div class="player-placeholder-ui  "><div class="video-item video-card-overlay" aria-labelledby="1876008003970-metadata-" title="LeBron James suffers ankle injury in loss to Hawks"><div class="thumbnail-wrapper"><div class="thumbnail-container"><img src="https://thumbnails.cbc.ca/maven_legacy/thumbnails/173/667/CP120325366_(1).jpg" alt class="thumbnail" loading="lazy" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></div></div><div class="video-item-info" id="1876008003970-metadata-"><div class="play-button-container" aria-label="Play media"><svg class="videoItemPlayBtn" role="presentation" width="34px" height="34px" viewBox="0 0 34 34" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><g id="Page-1" stroke="none" stroke-width="1" fill="none" fill-rule="evenodd"><g transform="translate(-49.000000, -1009.000000)" fill-rule="nonzero"><g transform="translate(49.000000, 1009.000000)"><g id="Group-Copy-31"><circle fill="#FFFFFF" cx="16.5" cy="16.5" r="16.5"/><path d="M12.0627845,9.87071431 L24.510661,16.6074648 C24.6396791,16.677289 24.6876652,16.8384825 24.617841,16.9675006 C24.5925502,17.0142319 24.553825,17.0523041 24.5066704,17.0767967 L12.0587939,23.5423393 C11.9286072,23.6099595 11.768253,23.5592393 11.7006328,23.4290526 C11.6809874,23.3912301 11.6707317,23.3492356 11.6707317,23.3066154 L11.6707317,10.1043222 C11.6707317,9.95762156 11.7896561,9.8386972 11.9363567,9.8386972 C11.9805052,9.8386972 12.0239575,9.84970124 12.0627845,9.87071431 Z" fill="#000000"/></g></g></g></g></svg></div><div class="video-item-details "><h3 class="video-item-title">LeBron James suffers ankle injury in loss to Hawks</h3><p class="video-show-name">Sports</p><span class="formattedDate video-time-stamp" aria-label="From 16 hours ago" aria-hidden="false">16 hours ago</span><div class="videoInfoLabel"><div class="videoDuration"><span aria-label="duration 0:38">0:38</span></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><span class="media-caption">Los Angeles Lakers star LeBron James injured his right ankle during the team's 99-94 loss to the Atlanta Hawks on Saturday.<!-- --> <!-- -->0:38</span></span></span></div>  <p>After the injury, James hit a corner three-pointer that extended his NBA-record streak of games with at least 10 points to 1,036, but he called a timeout and left the court shortly afterward. James knocked over a chair in frustration as he went to the locker room.</p>  <p>"The mood of the team is we're disappointed we lost, and we've got to come back and get one tomorrow," Lakers coach Frank Vogel said. "I won't disclose what LeBron was like [in the locker room]. It's in-house."</p>  <p>John Collins had 27 points and a season-high 16 rebounds, and Trae Young added 14 points and 11 assists for the Hawks. They opened an eight-game trip with their eighth straight victory under new coach Nate McMillan ‚Äî but only after their defending champion opponents lost their 17-time all-star to an injury that could shake the NBA's balance of power if it turns out to be serious.</p>  <div><span><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Nothing angers and saddens me more than not being available to and for my teammates!

Danilo Gallinari scored 14 of his 18 points after halftime for the Hawks, who are on their longest winning streak since January 2015.</p>  <p>"That was the first thing I told the guys: We can't relax because LeBron is out of the game," McMillan said. "We have to keep up the pressure, and I thought our guys did that."</p>  <div><span><ul class="similarLinks"><li class="similarListItem"><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/sports/basketball/nba/nba-to-relax-rules-for-vaccinated-individuals-1.5954791" class="similarLink" data-contentid flag text="NBA relaxing some health and safety rules for vaccinated individuals"><span class="similarLinkText">NBA relaxing some health and safety rules for vaccinated individuals</span></a></li></ul></span></div>  <p>James's absence left the Lakers without three starters in the second half, and the Hawks capitalized for their first road victory over Los Angeles since March 2016. Along with Davis, Marc Gasol missed his seventh straight game since February after sitting out under the NBA's health and safety protocols.</p>  <p>"It's different without [James], without AD," Gallinari said. "Of course they're a different team. But at the same time, all of the players that stepped up are all NBA veterans with experience, guys that won championships. I would say it's anyway a very good win."</p></span></div>
