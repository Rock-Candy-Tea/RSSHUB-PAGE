      <p>Imagine a group of bookish folk sitting around having a conversation about literature. Some work in the English departments of nearby universities. One ventures the idea that “a performative model of subject formation cannot be thought apart from its implication in regulatory practices operating within discursive regimes that circumscribe the ‘materiality’ of the subject through the citationality of norms.” </p>
       <p>What does it mean? Before anyone can decide, another participant muscles in: “The foreclosure of the performative in the Victorian novel,” he says, “is thus the condition of possibility of its disciplined re-emergence as the illocutionary hallucination of the performative as a material event of subjectivity that emerges in a discursive nexus that can be generally named ‘impersonation.’ ”</p>
      <p>You might think I’ve made this up. But while the group members don’t exist, the sentences do. They are taken from a book published by University of Michigan Press about “the novel.” I withhold the title and author’s name out of charity. These are examples of a way of writing common in academia. It is solipsistic, “performative”—one of its favorite expressions—and sealed. No one speaks like this and no one ever will. </p>
      <p>Yet the book in question would have been peer-reviewed, like all university press publications, and was no doubt courteously received by the author’s friends. It is a form of writing that has brought exclusivity to a point of perfection. The style derives from the project loosely known as deconstruction. Conceived in Paris to address subjects relating to power and privilege in society, and to investigate their workings in the literary canon, it began a takeover of English studies in the 1980s. The reverberations are felt today in the “decolonization” of curricula—the latest step being the banishing of allegedly “white supremacist” ancient classics—and in the toppling of statues and the renaming of schools. </p>
      <p>Until
      
      Jacques Derrida,
      
      Michel Foucault
      and others revolutionized literary studies, specialist writing was reserved for specialized disciplines—abstract algebra, for example. But literature by its nature resists marginalization. Since the time of Homer, it has been the common cultural conversation. The greatest writers in English, from
      
      Chaucer
      to Whitman by way of
      
      Shakespeare
      and
      
      Dickens,
      have all been popular writers. Only in the 20th century did the notion of literary elitism emerge, and only in the second part of the century did critical inquiry begin its evolution toward the kind of writing I quoted. Since none but a few can understand it, it must be the most elitist literary genre ever known. </p>
      
      <p>I have been drawn to literary criticism since books became central to my existence. Critics as unalike as
      
      T.S. Eliot
      and
      
      Virginia Woolf
      guide the reader toward a wider appreciation than might otherwise be possible. In many cases, the critical writing is as engaging as the work under discussion. And it helps to keep the right words in the right order. “If there were better criticism, there would be better books,”
      
      Toni Morrison
      told the New Republic in 1981.</p>
      <p>It isn’t difficult to see how criticism gets a bad reputation. But a reader may thrill to the formalism of
      
      Alexander Pope
      on Monday and revel in the informality of
      
      Allen Ginsberg
      on Tuesday, engaging with the criticism that attaches itself to each.
      
      John Ashbery’s
      cryptic poem “Self-Portrait in a Convex Mirror” doesn’t yield its meaning in the way a poem by
      
      Robert Frost
      does. But with persistence on the reader’s part, and insight from a helpful critic, Ashbery’s poem opens onto a new aesthetic vista. All hail the critic, then, whose function, as Eliot put it, is “the common pursuit of true judgement and the correction of taste.”</p>
      <p>How appealing it sounds. And how obsolete. What our imaginary friends discussing “discursive regimes that circumscribe the ‘materiality’ of the subject” would make of these terms can be guessed. Whose taste, after all? And who holds the privilege of correcting it? </p>
      <p>Such challenges render the “common pursuit” implausible in today’s literary climate. First-rate mainstream critics are still at work, in this journal and others, but concepts like taste and judgment have fallen beneath the wheels of new watchwords: wariness of “gatekeepers” (meaning, broadly, editors), for one. Any “correction,” the reasoning goes, should have to do with “historic underrepresentation.” Here, the untrammeled imagination presents itself not as a fount of invention but an instrument of oppression. If the end is to correct an unjust balance of power, the means must involve the abolition of quaint concepts such as “taste.” </p>
      
      <p>Anyone who gives even passing attention to the composition of book-prize short lists and the awarding of creative endowments is aware of how this new form of correction has become a leading driver in the way decisions are made. Some good may come of it, but be frank about the fact that gender and racial diversity are now essential components in all areas of contemporary critical judgment. You can call it the common pursuit of social justice. Or you could put it another way: Identity approval trumps critical approval.</p>
