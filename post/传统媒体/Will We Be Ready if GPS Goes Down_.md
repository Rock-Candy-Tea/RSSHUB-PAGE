      <p>GPS is vital to Americans, but hacking it has never been easier. Protecting the civilian Global Positioning System, an invisible utility the federal government pays for, falls to Transportation Secretary
      
      Pete Buttigieg.
      He would do well to use the results of the Transportation Department’s January <a href="https://www.transportation.gov/sites/dot.gov/files/2021-01/FY'18%20NDAA%20Section%201606%20DOT%20Report%20to%20Congress_Combinedv2_January%202021.pdf" target="_blank" class="icon none">report</a> on technologies that can back up GPS and keep the country moving in a pinch.</p>
       <p>Three separate laws, most recently the Frank LoBiondo Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2018, assign the Transportation Department the task of providing a backup to GPS. The LoBiondo Act required the secretary to put in place a backup system by the end of 2020, but no funds were appropriated, so the department couldn’t proceed.</p>
      <p>Although Congress hasn’t followed through with the money, the DOT’s new report lays out a road map. The department tested 11 technologies that could be used in the absence of GPS signals, including terrestrial radio signals, fiber networks for timing, Iridium satellites for encrypted signals, and Wi-Fi and cell signals for localization. This isn’t a partisan issue. Congress should allocate funds now.</p>
      <p>GPS depends on satellites, which can be damaged by electromagnetic storms or military attack. Even with the satellites intact, hacking incidents proliferate, using inexpensive, easily available hardware.</p>
      <p>In 2019 the British oil tanker Stena Impero was lured into Iranian waters in the Strait of Hormuz while its GPS, “spoofed” by the Iranians, told navigators it was in international waters. The ship was captured and its crew imprisoned in Iran for 10 weeks.</p>
      
      <p>Some GPS interference is unintentional. In January the Federal Aviation Administration traced pilots’ loss of GPS signal approaching North Carolina’s Wilmington International Airport not to hackers but to competing wireless signals from a nearby sewage plant. “It’s scary to be losing GPS a mile and half from the runway,”
      
      Thomas Goodwin,
      a member of the Wilmington Pilots Association, told me. </p>
      <p>The Coast Guard collects reports of gaps in GPS coverage all over the world. Examples in the last months of 2020 include ships in the Mediterranean and the Gulf of Suez, surveyors in Wyoming’s Bull Lake Dam, and a driver in Seattle.</p>
      <p>Pokémon Go, the augmented-reality game released in 2016, prompted armies of teen hackers to spoof the GPS on their phones, fudging their real locations for advantage. A program called iMyFone AnyTo advertises: “Change GPS Location on iOS Device in 1 Click.” Criminals hijack trucks, steal cargo and ship stolen vehicles in containers by jamming GPS signals to disable tracking devices. Truckers interrupt port operations by using GPS jammers to defeat fleet-tracking systems.</p>
      <p>When the first computers went on the market, no one saw a need for the now-ubiquitous antivirus software. Similarly, GPS was free from hacking in its early days, but today it needs protection. “The best way to protect GPS and satellite systems is to focus on protection of spectrum, tougher receivers and augmenting sources of positioning, navigation and timing,” says retired
      
      Adm. Thad Allen,
      a former Coast Guard commandant.</p>
      
      <p>The Transportation Department report concluded that multiple technologies should be used to complement GPS. NextNav, a California-based company, performed particularly well in urban areas with its Metropolitan Beacon System, a terrestrial network of long-range broadcast beacons. In rural and maritime areas, the Virginia-based Satelles displayed outstanding timing and location solutions, delivered over the Iridium constellation of 66 low-Earth-orbit satellites.</p>
      <p>The stakes are high. Americans use more than 900 million GPS receivers. You’ll find them in cellphones, commercial trucks and buses, and railroads. More than 100 million cars have navigation systems. Ships, planes and drones use GPS for navigation. Trucks use GPS not only for location services but also for electronic logging devices, which show whether drivers have been driving for too long and getting sleepy. Emergency responders use GPS rather than maps to locate accident sites and get people to the hospital. You don’t want to be waiting for the firetruck or ambulance when GPS is hacked or disrupted.</p>
      <p>John Deere tractors reduce agricultural costs by pinpointing precise locations to plant seeds, water and fertilize. The construction industry uses GPS to do the same with nails and studs. Surveyors use GPS for measurements that are out of their line of sight, especially in waterways. Electric power plants rely on the technology to synchronize generators and distribute energy to the grid.</p>
      <p>Americans depend on GPS too much for the federal government to wait for it to fail. A reliable backup is needed as soon as possible.</p>
