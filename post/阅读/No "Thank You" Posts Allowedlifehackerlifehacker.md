Simple 'thank you' posts with no substance are considered spam.<br><br>1. 'Thank you' posts are unnecessary, each categorized release already has a thank you button for that purpose. Every time somebody clicks the thank you thumb, 1 WRZ$ is automatically added to the uploader's account, at no cost to the user who clicked the button. If you still would like a more personal approach, please send a private message to the poster or consider donating WRZ$.<br><br>2. If all users made a 'thank you' post every time they felt grateful, releases would be endlessly brought back up to the front page in spite of no new material being added. The actual new releases would be constantly pushed to the background to the annoyance of posters and users alike.
