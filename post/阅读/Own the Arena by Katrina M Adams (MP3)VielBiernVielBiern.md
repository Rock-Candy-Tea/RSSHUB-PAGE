This single tennis championship, held annually in New York City, attracts top professionals from around the globe, generates more money than any other sporting event - or any other sport over an entire season - and attracts more than 700,000 attendees and millions of television viewers.<br><br>In Own the Arena, Katrina Adams offers a privileged, singular inside look at this sensational global event, while elaborating on what makes tennis the only sport of a lifetime. She opens with the women’s 2018 championship match between Naomi Osaka and Serena Williams that ended in boos. This was Adams’ last year as president, and the whole world was watching. How would she respond? How should the press be handled? What needs to be said to Osaka? Serena? What does this break from decorum mean for the Open and the sport?<br><br>As Adams shares a wealth of stories from her career and personal life, as well as insights from top tennis professionals, she provides invaluable information on meeting life’s tests both on the tennis court and off. Own the Arena offers fresh perspectives on having presence, being remembered, directing a conversation, and moving boldly in spaces where "you are the only one". It also covers good sportsmanship - treating others with respect and by being inclusive and open to diverse perspectives. Tennis is said to be 90 percent mental; this audiobook shows how to take the elements of mental fortitude and use them to achieve greatness.
