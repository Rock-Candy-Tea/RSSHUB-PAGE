<div class="tr_8510107"></div><div class="orig_8510107"><p>
Just off the highway to Rochester, Minnesota,<br>
Twilight bounds softly forth on the grass.<br>
And the eyes of those two Indian ponies<br>
Darken with kindness.<br>
They have come gladly out of the willows<br>
To welcome my friend and me.<br>
We step over the barbed wire into the pasture<br>
Where they have been grazing all day, alone.<br>
They ripple tensely, they can hardly contain their happiness<br>
That we have come.<br>
They bow shyly as wet swans.  They love each other.<br>
There is no loneliness like theirs.<br>
At home once more, they begin munching the young tufts of spring in the darkness.<br>
I would like to hold the slenderer one in my arms,<br>
For she has walked over to me<br>
And nuzzled my left hand.<br>
She is black and white,<br>
Her mane falls wild on her forehead,<br>
And the light breeze moves me to caress her long ear<br>
That is delicate as the skin over a girl's wrist.<br>
Suddenly I realize<br>
That if I stepped out of my body I would break<br>
Into blossom.</p></div><div class="copyright"><span class="author_copyright"> © by owner. provided at no charge for educational purposes <span class="nocolor"><span class="st_shares nocolor"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?app_id=113613998666044&display=popup&sdk=joey&u=https%3A%2F%2Fallpoetry.com%2F8510107" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-facebook-square"></i> </a><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?related=all_poetry&text=A+Blessing+by+James+Wright+%40all_poetry&url=https%3A%2F%2Fallpoetry.com%2F8510107" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-twitter-square"></i> </a><a class="no_pop" href="mailto:?body=I%20wanted%20to%20share%20this%20with%20you%3A%20A%20Blessing%20by%20James%20Wright%0A%0Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fallpoetry.com%2F8510107&subject=A%20Blessing%20by%20James%20Wright"><i class="fa fa-envelope-o"></i> </a></span></span></span></div>
