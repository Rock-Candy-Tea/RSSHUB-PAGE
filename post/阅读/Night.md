Your hand is heavy, Night, upon my brow.<br>
I bear no heart mercuric like the clouds,<br>
to dare.<br>
Exacerbation from your subtle plough.<br>
Woman as a clam, on the sea's cresent.<br>
I saw your jealous eye quench the sea's<br>
Flouorescence, dance on the pulse incessant<br>
Of the waves. And I stood, drained<br>
Submitting like the sands, blood and brine<br>
Coursing to the roots. Night, you rained<br>
Serrated shadows through dank leaves<br>
Till, bathed in warm suffusion of your dappled cells<br>
  Sensations pained me, faceless, silent as night thieves.<br>
Hide me now, when night children haunt the earth<br>
I must hear none! These misted cells will yet<br>
Undo me; naked, unbidden, at Night's muted birth.</p></div><div class="copyright"><span class="author_copyright"> © by owner. provided at no charge for educational purposes <span class="nocolor"><span class="st_shares nocolor"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?app_id=113613998666044&display=popup&sdk=joey&u=https%3A%2F%2Fallpoetry.com%2F10379361" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-facebook-square"></i> </a><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?related=all_poetry&text=Night+by+Wole+Soyinka+%40all_poetry&url=https%3A%2F%2Fallpoetry.com%2F10379361" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-twitter-square"></i> </a><a class="no_pop" href="mailto:?body=I%20wanted%20to%20share%20this%20with%20you%3A%20Night%20by%20Wole%20Soyinka%0A%0Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fallpoetry.com%2F10379361&subject=Night%20by%20Wole%20Soyinka"><i class="fa fa-envelope-o"></i> </a></span></span></span></div>
