They served in the regular army and the Waffen-SS. And, remarkably, they were also Jewish, at least as defined by Hitler's infamous race laws. Pursuing the thread he first unraveled in Hitler's Jewish Soldiers, Bryan Rigg takes a closer look at the experiences of Wehrmacht soldiers who were classified as Jewish. In this long-awaited companion volume, he presents interviews with twenty-one of these men, whose stories are both fascinating and disturbing.Chilling, compelling, almost beyond belief, these stories depict crises of conscience under the most stressful circumstances. Lives of Hitler's Jewish Soldiers deepens our understanding of the complex intersection of Nazi race laws and German military service both before and during World War II.<br><span style="font-weight: bold">Genre:</span> Non-Fiction > History <br><br><img src="https://images.mobilism.org/?dm=0JZA" alt="Image" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline">Download Instructions:</span><br><a class="postlink" href="https://rg.to/file/446bd38114930219d3013d8cd77922f2">https://rg.to/file/446bd38114930219d3013d8cd77922f2</a>
