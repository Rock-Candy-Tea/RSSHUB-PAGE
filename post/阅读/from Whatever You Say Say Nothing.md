I</p>
<p>
 </p>
<p>
I'm writing this just after an encounter</p>
<p>
With an English journalist in search of 'views</p>
<p>
On the Irish thing'.  I'm back in winter</p>
<p>
Quarters where bad news is no longer news,</p>
<p>
 </p>
<p>
Where media men and stringers sniff and point,</p>
<p>
Where zoom lenses, recorders and coiled leads</p>
<p>
Litter the hotels.  The times are out of joint</p>
<p>
But I incline as much to rosary beads</p>
<p>
 </p>
<p>
As to the jottings and analyses</p>
<p>
of politicians and newspapermen</p>
<p>
Who've scribbled down the long campaign from gas</p>
<p>
And protest to gelignite and sten,</p>
<p>
 </p>
<p>
Who proved upon their pulses 'escalate',</p>
<p>
'Backlash' and 'crackdown', 'the provisional wing',</p>
<p>
'Polarization' and 'long-standing hate'.</p>
<p>
Yet I live here, I live here too, I sing,</p>
<p>
 </p>
<p>
Expertly civil tongued with civil neighbors</p>
<p>
On the high wires of first wireless reports,</p>
<p>
Sucking the fake taste, the stony flavours</p>
<p>
Of those sanctioned, old, elaborate retorts:</p>
<p>
 </p>
<p>
'Oh, it's disgraceful, surely, I agree.'</p>
<p>
'Where's it going to end?  It's getting worse.'</p>
<p>
'They're murderers.'  'Internment, understandably...'</p>
<p>
The voice of sanity is getting hoarse.</p>
<p>
 </p>
<p>
III</p>
<p>
 </p>
<p>
'Religion's never mentioned here,' of course.</p>
<p>
'You know them by their eyes,' and hold your tongue.</p>
<p>
'One side's as bad as the other,' never worse.</p>
<p>
Christ, it's near time that some small leak was sprung</p>
<p>
 </p>
<p>
In the great dykes the Dutchman made</p>
<p>
To dam the dangerous tide that followed Seamus.</p>
<p>
Yet for all this art and sedentary trade</p>
<p>
I am incapable.  The famous</p>
<p>
 </p>
<p>
Northern reticence, the tight gag of place</p>
<p>
And times: yes, yes.  Of the 'wee six' I sing</p>
<p>
Where to be saved you only must save face</p>
<p>
And whatever you say, you say nothing.</p>
<p>
 </p>
<p>
Smoke-signals are loud-mouthed compared with us:</p>
<p>
Manoeuvrings to find out name and school,</p>
<p>
Subtle discrimination by addresses</p>
<p>
With hardly an exception to the rule</p>
<p>
 </p>
<p>
That Norman, Ken and Sidney signalled Prod</p>
<p>
And Seamus (Call me Sean) was sure-fired Pape.</p>
<p>
O land of password, handgrip, wink and nod,</p>
<p>
Of open minds as open as a trap,</p>
<p>
 </p>
<p>
Where tongues lie coiled, as under flames lie wicks,</p>
<p>
Where half of us, as in a wooden horse</p>
<p>
Were cabin'd and confined like wily Greeks,</p>
<p>
Besieged within the siege, whispering morse.</p>
<p>
 </p>
<p>
IV</p>
<p>
 </p>
<p>
This morning from the dewy motorway</p>
<p>
I saw the new camp for the internees:</p>
<p>
A bomb had left a crater of fresh clay</p>
<p>
In the roadside, and over in the trees</p>
<p>
 </p>
<p>
Machine-gun posts defined a real stockade.</p>
<p>
There was that white mist you get on a low ground</p>
<p>
And it was deja-vu, some film made</p>
<p>
of Stalag 17, a bad dream with no sound.</p>
<p>
 </p>
<p>
Is there a life before death?  That's chalked up</p>
<p>
In Ballymurphy.  Competence with pain,</p>
<p>
Coherent mistress, a bite and sup,</p>
<p>
We hug our little destiny again.</p>
<p>
