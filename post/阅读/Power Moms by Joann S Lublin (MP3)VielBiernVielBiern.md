Over the past several decades, women have made gains throughout executive suites. Yet these “Power Moms” still struggle with balancing their management responsibilities with raising children. Joann S. Lublin draws on the experiences of the nation’s two generations of these successful women to measure how far we’ve come - and how far we still need to go.<br><br>Lublin combines her own insights with those of 85 executive mothers across industries - including experienced public-company chiefs such as Carol Bartz, the first woman to command Autodesk and Yahoo; Hershey’s Michele Buck; DuPont’s Ellen Kullman; ITT’s Denise Ramos; and WW International’s Mindy Grossman - and 25 of their grown daughters. Lublin reveals how trailblazer boomers, many now in their 60s, often endured sweeping disapproval for their demanding management careers, even as their own daughters sometimes rejected their choices. While the second wave of executive mothers - all under 45 - handle working parenthood with less angst, they still lead stressful lives.<br><br>Power Moms provides lessons and advice to help today’s professional women, their families, and their employers navigate this challenging terrain. Lublin looks at the trade-offs mothers are too often forced to make between work and family and the root causes, including the dearth of large-scale paid parental leave and other family-friendly policies. While it celebrates the gains women have made, Power Moms makes clear how much more must be done to make being a working mother easier.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline">Download Instructions:</span><br><a class="postlink" href="https://rapidgator.net/file/d9ccb995144688eeae35f0513ca34cc3/Power_Moms.rar.html">https://rapidgator.net/file/d9ccb995144688eeae35f0513ca34cc3/Power_Moms.rar.html</a><br><a class="postlink" href="https://katfile.com/b36o4j1hxsnz/Power_Moms.rar.html">https://katfile.com/b36o4j1hxsnz/Power_Moms.rar.html</a><br><br>Trouble downloading?
