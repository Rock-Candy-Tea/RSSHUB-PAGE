Become a master of spice with these 75 easy recipes for big, bold flavor. Mike Hultquist, creator of the blog Chili Pepper Madness and author of The Spicy Dehydrator Cookbook, takes you head first into the wide world of all things spicy. Explore peppers, like poblanos, jalapeños and cayennes, along with spice blends, hot sauces and more. As you cook your way through exciting, spice-rich cuisines like Mexican, Italian and Indian, you’ll discover how simple it is to layer pepper varieties and spices for incredible depth of flavor. Learn how to achieve just the right amount of zing, whether mild, medium or sizzling. For a memorable meal that’s low on heat, try Sweet-Chili Glazed Bacon-Wrapped Pork Tenderloin, which mixes sweet red pepper jam with your favorite hot sauce. Bring it up a notch with Shrimp in Fiery Chipotle-Tequila Sauce, which blends deep chipotle flavor with a kick of serrano pepper. If it’s mouth-numbing spice you’re after, go for the All-the-Way Arrabiata, a satisfying pasta dish amped up with pepper infused olive oil and whole ghost peppers. With stews for your slow cooker, burgers for the grill, and eggs for the skillet, it’s easy to enjoy an amazing array of spicy dishes, all day, every day.<br><span style="font-weight: bold">Genre:</span> Non-Fiction > Food & Drink <br><br><img src="https://images.mobilism.org/?dm=XM2V" alt="Image" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline">Download Instructions:</span><br><a class="postlink" href="https://userupload.net/hz5aon2l8rsv">https://userupload.net/hz5aon2l8rsv</a>
