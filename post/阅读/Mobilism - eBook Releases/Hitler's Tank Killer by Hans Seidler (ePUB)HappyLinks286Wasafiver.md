By 1943 its main role was providing anti-tank support to the units in its area of operation. This consequently led to many StuGs being destroyed in battle. Nonetheless they were very successful as tank killers and destroyed, among others, many bunkers, pillboxes and other defences.
<br>The StuG was not considered to be a true tank because it lacked a turret. The gun was mounded directly in the hull, in a casemate-style fashion, with a low profile to reduce vehicle heights, and had a limited lateral traverse of a few degrees in either direction. Thus, the entire vehicle had to be turned in order to acquire targets. Omitting the turret made production much simpler and less costly, enabling greater numbers to be built. Its significantly shorter vertical profile as compared to contemporary tanks made the StuG more difficult to hit. <br><span style="font-weight: bold">Genre:</span> Non-Fiction > History <br><br><img src="https://images.mobilism.org/?dm=OJOG" alt="Image" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline">Download Instructions:</span><br><a class="postlink" href="https://userupload.net/hv04sng24r12">https://userupload.net/hv04sng24r12</a>
