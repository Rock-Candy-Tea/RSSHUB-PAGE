<span style="font-weight: bold">Crisis in the Pacific: The Battles for the Philippine Islands by the Men Who Fought Them by Gerald Astor</span><br><span style="text-decoration: underline">Requirements:</span> .ePUB reader, 4.5 MB<br><span style="text-decoration: underline">Overview:</span> From the depths of defeat...
<br>On December 8, 1941, one day after the bombing of Pearl Harbor, the Japanese Air Force struck the Philippines in the first blow of a devastating invasion.
<br>With an undersupplied patchwork army at his command, General Douglas MacArthur led a valiant defense of the Philippines. When defeat came, MacArthur swore he would return, while thousands of POWs fell into Japanese hands — and faced a living hell that many would not survive.
<br>To the dawn of victory...
<br>In this gripping oral history, Gerald Astor brings to life the struggle to recapture the Philippines: the men who did the fighting, the battles that set the stage for an Allied invasion, and the acts of astounding courage and desperation that marked the campaign on both sides.
<br>From Corregidor to the Battle for Manila, from horrifying jungle warfare to cataclysmic clashes at sea, on beachheads and in the air, Crisis in the Pacific draws on the words of the men who were there capturing this crucial heroic struggle for victory against Japan.<br><span style="font-weight: bold">Genre:</span> Non-Fiction > History <br><br><img src="https://images.mobilism.org/?dm=WPA1" alt="Image" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline">Download Instructions:</span><br><a class="postlink" href="http://filebonus.net/s4cqyyy68cor">http://filebonus.net/s4cqyyy68cor</a>
