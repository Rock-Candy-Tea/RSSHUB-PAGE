<div class="tr_11025955"></div><div class="orig_11025955"><p>
My father worked with a horse-plough,</p>
<p>
His shoulders globed like a full sail strung</p>
<p>
Between the shafts and the furrow.</p>
<p>
The horses strained at his clicking tongue.</p>
<p>
 </p>
<p>
An expert. He would set the wing</p>
<p>
And fit the bright steel-pointed sock.</p>
<p>
The sod rolled over without breaking.</p>
<p>
At the headrig, with a single pluck</p>
<p>
 </p>
<p>
Of reins, the sweating team turned round</p>
<p>
And back into the land.  His eye</p>
<p>
Narrowed and angled at the ground,</p>
<p>
Mapping the furrow exactly.</p>
<p>
 </p>
<p>
I stumbled in his hob-nailed wake,</p>
<p>
Fell sometimes on the polished sod;</p>
<p>
Sometimes he rode me on his back</p>
<p>
Dipping and rising to his plod.</p>
<p>
 </p>
<p>
I wanted to grow up and plough,</p>
<p>
To close one eye, stiffen my arm.</p>
<p>
All I ever did was follow</p>
<p>
In his broad shadow round the farm.</p>
<p>
 </p>
<p>
I was a nuisance, tripping, falling,</p>
<p>
Yapping always.  But today</p>
<p>
It is my father who keeps stumbling</p>
<p>
Behind me, and will not go away.</p></div><div class="copyright">from "Death of a Naturalist" (1966)<span class="author_copyright"> © by owner. provided at no charge for educational purposes <span class="nocolor"><span class="st_shares nocolor"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?app_id=113613998666044&display=popup&sdk=joey&u=https%3A%2F%2Fallpoetry.com%2F11025955" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-facebook-square"></i> </a><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?related=all_poetry&text=Follower+by+Seamus+Heaney+%40all_poetry&url=https%3A%2F%2Fallpoetry.com%2F11025955" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-twitter-square"></i> </a><a class="no_pop" href="mailto:?body=I%20wanted%20to%20share%20this%20with%20you%3A%20Follower%20by%20Seamus%20Heaney%0A%0Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fallpoetry.com%2F11025955&subject=Follower%20by%20Seamus%20Heaney"><i class="fa fa-envelope-o"></i> </a></span></span></span></div>
