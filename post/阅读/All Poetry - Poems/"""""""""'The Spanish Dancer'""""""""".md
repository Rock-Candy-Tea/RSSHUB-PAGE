<div class="tr_8505651"></div><div class="orig_8505651">As on all its sides a kitchen-match darts white<br>
 flickering tongues before it bursts into flame:<br>
 with the audience around her, quickened, hot,<br>
 her dance begins to flicker in the dark room.<br>
<br>
 And all at once it is completely fire.<br>
<br>
 One upward glance and she ignites her hair<br>
 and, whirling faster and faster, fans her dress<br>
 into passionate flames, till it becomes a furnace<br>
 from which, like startled rattlesnakes, the long<br>
 naked arms uncoil, aroused and clicking.<br>
<br>
 And then: as if the fire were too tight<br>
 around her body, she takes and flings it out<br>
 haughtily, with an imperious gesture,<br>
 and watches: it lies raging on the floor,<br>
 still blazing up, and the flames refuse to die -<br>
 Till, moving with total confidence and a sweet<br>
 exultant smile, she looks up finally<br>
 and stamps it out with powerful small feet.</div><div class="copyright"><span class="author_copyright"> © by owner. provided at no charge for educational purposes <span class="nocolor"><span class="st_shares nocolor"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?app_id=113613998666044&display=popup&sdk=joey&u=https%3A%2F%2Fallpoetry.com%2F8505651" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-facebook-square"></i> </a><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?related=all_poetry&text=The+Spanish+Dancer+by+Rainer+Maria+Rilke+%40all_poetry&url=https%3A%2F%2Fallpoetry.com%2F8505651" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-twitter-square"></i> </a><a class="no_pop" href="mailto:?body=I%20wanted%20to%20share%20this%20with%20you%3A%20The%20Spanish%20Dancer%20by%20Rainer%20Maria%20Rilke%0A%0Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fallpoetry.com%2F8505651&subject=The%20Spanish%20Dancer%20by%20Rainer%20Maria%20Rilke"><i class="fa fa-envelope-o"></i> </a></span></span></span></div>
