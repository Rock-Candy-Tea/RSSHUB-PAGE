<div class="tr_8546815"></div><div class="orig_8546815"><p>
Under the mountain, as when first I knew<br>
Its low dark roof, and chimney creeper-twined,<br>
The red house stands; and yet my footsteps find<br>
Vague in the walks, waste balm and fever few.<br>
But they are gone: no soft-eyed sisters trip<br>
Across the porch or lintels; where, behind,<br>
The mother sat,—sat knitting with pursed lip.<br>
The house stands vacant in its green recess,<br>
Absent of beauty as a broken heart;<br>
The wild rain enters, and the sunset wind<br>
Sighs in the chambers of their loveliness,<br>
Or shakes the pane; and in the silent noons,<br>
The glass falls from the window, part by part,<br>
And ringeth faintly in the grassy stones.</p></div><div class="copyright"><span class="author_copyright"> © by owner. provided at no charge for educational purposes <span class="nocolor"><span class="st_shares nocolor"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?app_id=113613998666044&display=popup&sdk=joey&u=https%3A%2F%2Fallpoetry.com%2F8546815" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-facebook-square"></i> </a><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?related=all_poetry&text=%22Under+the+mountain...%22+by+Frederick+Goddard+Tuckerman+%40all_poetry&url=https%3A%2F%2Fallpoetry.com%2F8546815" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-twitter-square"></i> </a><a class="no_pop" href="mailto:?body=I%20wanted%20to%20share%20this%20with%20you%3A%20%22Under%20the%20mountain...%22%20by%20Frederick%20Goddard%20Tuckerman%0A%0Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fallpoetry.com%2F8546815&subject=%22Under%20the%20mountain...%22%20by%20Frederick%20Goddard%20Tuckerman"><i class="fa fa-envelope-o"></i> </a></span></span></span></div>
