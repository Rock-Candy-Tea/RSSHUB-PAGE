<em>FERRARA</em><br><br>
That's my last Duchess painted on the wall,<br>
Looking as if she were alive.  I call<br>
That piece a wonder, now: Fr Pandolf's hands<br>
Worked busily a day, and there she stands.<br>
Will't please you sit and look at her? I said<br>
``Fr Pandolf'' by design, for never read<br>
Strangers like you that pictured countenance,<br>
The depth and passion of its earnest glance,<br>
But to myself they turned (since none puts by<br>
The curtain I have drawn for you, but I)<br>
And seemed as they would ask me, if they durst,<br>
How such a glance came there; so, not the first<br>
Are you to turn and ask thus.  Sir, 'twas not<br>
Her husband's presence only, called that spot<br>
Of joy into the Duchess' cheek: perhaps<br>
Fr Pandolf chanced to say ``Her mantle laps<br>
``Over my lady's wrist too much,'' or ``Paint<br>
``Must never hope to reproduce the faint<br>
``Half-flush that dies along her throat:'' such stuff<br>
Was courtesy, she thought, and cause enough<br>
For calling up that spot of joy.  She had<br>
A heart—-how shall I say?—-too soon made glad,<br>
Too easily impressed; she liked whate'er<br>
She looked on, and her looks went everywhere.  <br>
Sir, 'twas all one! My favour at her breast,<br>
The dropping of the daylight in the West,<br>
The bough of cherries some officious fool<br>
Broke in the orchard for her, the white mule<br>
She rode with round the terrace—-all and each<br>
Would draw from her alike the approving speech,<br>
Or blush, at least.  She thanked men,—-good! but thanked<br>
Somehow—-I know not how—-as if she ranked<br>
My gift of a nine-hundred-years-old name<br>
With anybody's gift.  Who'd stoop to blame<br>
This sort of trifling? Even had you skill<br>
In speech—-(which I have not)—-to make your will<br>
Quite clear to such an one, and say, ``Just this<br>
``Or that in you disgusts me; here you miss,<br>
``Or there exceed the mark''—-and if she let<br>
Herself be lessoned so, nor plainly set<br>
Her wits to yours, forsooth, and made excuse,<br>
—-E'en then would be some stooping; and I choose<br>
Never to stoop.  Oh sir, she smiled, no doubt,<br>
Whene'er I passed her; but who passed without<br>
Much the same smile? This grew; I gave commands;<br>
Then all smiles stopped together.  There she stands<br>
As if alive.  Will't please you rise? We'll meet<br>
The company below, then.  I repeat,<br>
The Count your master's known munificence<br>
Is ample warrant that no just pretence<br>
Of mine for dowry will be disallowed;<br>
Though his fair daughter's self, as I avowed<br>
At starting, is my object.  Nay, we'll go<br>
Together down, sir. Notice Neptune, though,<br>
Taming a sea-horse, thought a rarity,<br>
Which Claus of Innsbruck cast in bronze for me!</p></div><div class="copyright"><iframe width="100%" height="300" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" allow="autoplay" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//soundcloud.com/anton-jarvis-206182017/sonnet-29-i-think-of-thee-by-elizabeth-barrett-browning&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true&visual=true"></iframe><span class="author_copyright"> © by owner. provided at no charge for educational purposes <span class="nocolor"><span class="st_shares nocolor"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?app_id=113613998666044&display=popup&sdk=joey&u=https%3A%2F%2Fallpoetry.com%2F8438921" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-facebook-square"></i> </a><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?related=all_poetry&text=My+Last+Duchess+by+Robert+Browning+%40all_poetry&url=https%3A%2F%2Fallpoetry.com%2F8438921" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-twitter-square"></i> </a><a class="no_pop" href="mailto:?body=I%20wanted%20to%20share%20this%20with%20you%3A%20My%20Last%20Duchess%20by%20Robert%20Browning%0A%0Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fallpoetry.com%2F8438921&subject=My%20Last%20Duchess%20by%20Robert%20Browning"><i class="fa fa-envelope-o"></i> </a></span></span></span></div>
