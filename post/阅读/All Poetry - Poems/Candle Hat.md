In most self-portraits it is the face that dominates:<br>
Cezanne is a pair of eyes swimming in brushstrokes,<br>
Van Gogh stares out of a halo of swirling darkness,<br>
Rembrant looks relieved as if he were taking a breather<br>
from painting The Blinding of Sampson.</p>
<p>
 </p>
<p>
But in this one Goya stands well back from the mirror<br>
and is seen posed in the clutter of his studio<br>
addressing a canvas tilted back on a tall easel.</p>
<p>
He appears to be smiling out at us as if he knew<br>
we would be amused by the extraordinary hat on his head<br>
which is fitted around the brim with candle holders,<br>
a device that allowed him to work into the night.</p>
<p>
 </p>
<p>
You can only wonder what it would be like<br>
to be wearing such a chandelier on your head<br>
as if you were a walking dining room or concert hall.</p>
<p>
But once you see this hat there is no need to read<br>
any biography of Goya or to memorize his dates.</p>
<p>
 </p>
<p>
To understand Goya you only have to imagine him<br>
lighting the candles one by one, then placing<br>
the hat on his head, ready for a night of work.</p>
<p>
Imagine him surprising his wife with his new invention,<br>
the laughing like a birthday cake when she saw the glow.</p>
<p>
 </p>
<p>
Imagine him flickering through the rooms of his house<br>
with all the shadows flying across the walls.</p>
<p>
Imagine a lost traveler knocking on his door<br>
one dark night in the hill country of Spain.<br>
"Come in, " he would say, "I was just painting myself,"<br>
as he stood in the doorway holding up the wand of a brush,<br>
illuminated in the blaze of his famous candle hat.</p></div><div class="copyright"><span class="author_copyright"> © by owner. provided at no charge for educational purposes <span class="nocolor"><span class="st_shares nocolor"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?app_id=113613998666044&display=popup&sdk=joey&u=https%3A%2F%2Fallpoetry.com%2F9742227" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-facebook-square"></i> </a><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?related=all_poetry&text=Candle+Hat+by+Billy+Collins+%40all_poetry&url=https%3A%2F%2Fallpoetry.com%2F9742227" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-twitter-square"></i> </a><a class="no_pop" href="mailto:?body=I%20wanted%20to%20share%20this%20with%20you%3A%20Candle%20Hat%20by%20Billy%20Collins%0A%0Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fallpoetry.com%2F9742227&subject=Candle%20Hat%20by%20Billy%20Collins"><i class="fa fa-envelope-o"></i> </a></span></span></span></div>
