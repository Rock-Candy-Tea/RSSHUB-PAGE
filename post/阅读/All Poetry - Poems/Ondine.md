At supper time an ondine’s narrow feet<br>
made dark tracks on the hearth.<br>
Like the heart of a yellow fruit was the fire’s heat,<br>
but they rubbed together quite blue with the cold.<br>
The sandy hem of her skirt dripped on the floor.<br>
She sat there with a silvered cedar knot<br>
for a low stool; and I sat opposite,<br>
my lips and eyelids hot<br>
in the heat of the fire. Piling on dry bark,<br>
seeing that no steam went up from her dark dress,<br>
I felt uneasiness<br>
as though firm sand had shifted under my feet<br>
in the wash of a wave.<br><br><br>
I brought her soup from the stove and she would not eat,<br>
but sat there crying her cold tears,<br>
her blue lips quivering with cold and grief.<br>
She blamed me for a thief,<br>
saying that I had burned a piece of wood<br>
the tide washed up. And I said, No,<br>
the tide had washed it out again; and even so,<br>
a piece of sodden wood was not so rare<br>
as polished agate stones or ambergris.<br><br><br>
She stood and wrung her hair<br>
so that the water made a sudden splash<br>
on the round rug by the door. I saw her go<br>
across the little footbridge to the beach.<br>
After, I threw the knot on the hot coals.<br>
It fell apart and burned with a white flash,<br>
a crackling roar in the chimney and dark smoke.<br>
I beat it out with a poker<br>
in the soft ash.<br><br><br>
Now I am frightened on the shore at night,<br>
and all the phosphorescent swells that rise<br>
come towards me with the threat of her dark eyes<br>
with a cold firelight in them;<br>
and crooked driftwood writhes<br>
in dry sand when I pass.<br><br><br>
Should she return and bring her sisters with her,<br>
the withdrawing tide<br>
would leave a long pool in my bed.<br>
There would be nothing more of me this side<br>
the melting foamline of the latest wave.</p></div><div class="copyright"><span class="author_copyright"> © by owner. provided at no charge for educational purposes <span class="nocolor"><span class="st_shares nocolor"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?app_id=113613998666044&display=popup&sdk=joey&u=https%3A%2F%2Fallpoetry.com%2F8622787" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-facebook-square"></i> </a><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?related=all_poetry&text=Ondine+by+Mary+Barnard+%40all_poetry&url=https%3A%2F%2Fallpoetry.com%2F8622787" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-twitter-square"></i> </a><a class="no_pop" href="mailto:?body=I%20wanted%20to%20share%20this%20with%20you%3A%20Ondine%20by%20Mary%20Barnard%0A%0Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fallpoetry.com%2F8622787&subject=Ondine%20by%20Mary%20Barnard"><i class="fa fa-envelope-o"></i> </a></span></span></span></div>
