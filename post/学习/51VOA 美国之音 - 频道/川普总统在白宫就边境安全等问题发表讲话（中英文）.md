<p>My fellow Americans: Tonight, I am speaking to you because there is a growing humanitarian and security crisis at our southern border.<br>我的美国同胞们，今晚我向你们讲话，因为在我们的南部边境正有一场越来越严重的人道和安全危机。</p>
<p>Every day, Customs and Border Patrol agents encounter thousands of illegal immigrants trying to enter our country.  We are out of space to hold them, and we have no way to promptly return them back home to their country.<br>每一天，海关与边境巡逻人员遇到数以千计试图进入我国的非法移民。我们没有容纳他们的空间了。我们没有办法立即把他们送回本国。</p>
<p>America proudly welcomes millions of lawful immigrants who enrich our society and contribute to our nation.  But all Americans are hurt by uncontrolled, illegal migration.  It strains public resources and drives down jobs and wages.  Among those hardest hit are African Americans and Hispanic Americans.<br>美国自豪地欢迎数以百万计的合法移民，他们使我们的社会更加丰富，为我们的国家做出贡献。但是，不受控制的非法移民伤害了所有美国人。它给公共资源带来压力，压低就业和工资。受害最严重的包括非洲裔美国人和拉美裔美国人。</p>
<p>Our southern border is a pipeline for vast quantities of illegal drugs, including meth, heroin, cocaine, and fentanyl. Every week, 300 of our citizens are killed by heroin alone, 90 percent of which floods across from our southern border.  More Americans will die from drugs this year than were killed in the entire Vietnam War.<br>我们的南部边境是大量非法药物的输送渠道，包括冰毒、海洛因、可卡因和芬太尼。每个星期，仅仅海洛因就造成我们300名公民的死亡，90%通过南部边境涌入。今年，死于毒品的美国人将超过整个越南战争期间被打死的美国人。</p>
<p>In the last two years, ICE officers made 266,000 arrests of aliens with criminal records, including those charged or convicted of 100,000 assaults, 30,000 sex crimes, and 4,000 violent killings.  Over the years, thousands of Americans have been brutally killed by those who illegally entered our country, and thousands more lives will be lost if we don’t act right now.<br>过去两年来，移民与海关执法局人员逮捕了26万6千有刑事犯罪记录的外国人，包括那些被指控或判定犯有10万项攻击罪、3万项性犯罪和4千项暴力杀人罪的人。多年来，数以千计的美国人被那些非法进入我国的人所残杀，如果我们不立刻采取行动，还会有数以千计的人失去生命。</p>
<p>This is a humanitarian crisis — a crisis of the heart and a crisis of the soul.<br>这是一场人道危机，一场触及人心的危机，一场触及灵魂的危机。<br>Last month, 20,000 migrant children were illegally brought into the United States — a dramatic increase.  These children are used as human pawns by vicious coyotes and ruthless gangs.  One in three women are sexually assaulted on the dangerous trek up through Mexico.  Women and children are the biggest victims, by far, of our broken system.<br>上个月，2万名移民儿童被非法带入美国，人数急剧增长。这些孩子被恶毒的蛇头和残酷的帮派拿来利用。三分之一的妇女在通过墨西哥的危险旅途中受到性侵。妇女和儿童是我们失灵的系统最大的受害者，远超过任何人。</p>
<p>This is the tragic reality of illegal immigration on our southern border.  This is the cycle of human suffering that I am determined to end.<br>这是我们南部边界非法移民的悲惨现实。我决心要制止这种人类痛苦的循环。</p>
<p>My administration has presented Congress with a detailed proposal to secure the border and stop the criminal gangs, drug smugglers, and human traffickers.  It’s a tremendous problem.  Our proposal was developed by law enforcement professionals and border agents at the Department of Homeland Security.  These are the resources they have requested to properly perform their mission and keep America safe.  In fact, safer than ever before.<br>我的政府已向国会提出了详细的建议，以确保边境安全并制止犯罪帮派、毒品走私者和人口拐卖者。这是一个严重的问题。我们的建议是由国土安全部的专业执法人员和边境人员制定的。这些是他们要求得到的资源，以恰当履行使命并保护美国安全。事实上，是让美国比所有时候都更安全。</p>
<p>The proposal from Homeland Security includes cutting-edge technology for detecting drugs, weapons, illegal contraband, and many other things.  We have requested more agents, immigration judges, and bed space to process the sharp rise in unlawful migration fueled by our very strong economy.  Our plan also contains an urgent request for humanitarian assistance and medical support.<br>国土安全部的建议包括使用先进技术，用来侦测毒品、武器、非法违禁物和其它很多物品。我们要求能有更多的执法人员、移民法官和床位，以受理急剧上升的非法移民，我们非常强劲的经济助长了这种上升。我们的方案还包括得到紧急人道协助和医疗支持。</p>
<p>Furthermore, we have asked Congress to close border security loopholes so that illegal immigrant children can be safely and humanely returned back home.<br>此外，我们已要求国会堵住边境安全的漏洞，以便安全和人道地把非法移民儿童送回他们的国家。</p>
<p>Finally, as part of an overall approach to border security, law enforcement professionals have requested $5.7 billion for a physical barrier.  At the request of Democrats, it will be a steel barrier rather than a concrete wall.  This barrier is absolutely critical to border security.  It’s also what our professionals at the border want and need.  This is just common sense.<br>最后，作为边境安全整体措施的一部分，专业执法人员要求拨款57亿美元，修建实体屏障。在民主党人的要求下，这将是一道钢铁屏障，而不是水泥墙。这道屏障对边界安全绝对至关重要。这也是我们的专业执法人员所希望和需要的。这完全是常识。</p>
<p>The border wall would very quickly pay for itself.   The cost of illegal drugs exceeds $500 billion a year — vastly more than the $5.7 billion we have requested from Congress.  The wall will also be paid for, indirectly, by the great new trade deal we have made with Mexico.<br>边界墙很快将收回成本。每年，非法药物的代价就超过5千亿美元，远远超过我们要求国会提供的57亿美元。这道墙将永远由我们与墨西哥达成的新的、很棒的贸易协议来间接支付。</p>
<p>Senator Chuck Schumer — who you will be hearing from later tonight — has repeatedly supported a physical barrier in the past, along with many other Democrats.  They changed their mind only after I was elected President.<br>你们今晚将听到查克·舒默参议员的讲话。他过去跟很多民主党人一道一再支持实体屏障。他们只是在我当选总统后改变了想法。</p>
<p>Democrats in Congress have refused to acknowledge the crisis.  And they have refused to provide our brave border agents with the tools they desperately need to protect our families and our nation.<br>国会的民主党人拒绝承认危机。他们拒绝为我们勇敢的边境人员提供他们为保护我们的家庭和我们的国家而急需的工具。</p>
<p>The federal government remains shut down for one reason and one reason only: because Democrats will not fund border security.<br>联邦政府仍处在关闭状态，一个原因、而且唯一的原因就是民主党人不为边境安全拨款。</p>
<p>My administration is doing everything in our power to help those impacted by the situation.  But the only solution is for Democrats to pass a spending bill that defends our borders and re-opens the government.<br>我的政府正在尽我们的一切能力来帮助那些受到这一局面影响的人。但是危机的解决办法是民主党人通过一项议案，保护我们的边境并让政府重新开门。</p>
<p>This situation could be solved in a 45-minute meeting.  I have invited Congressional leadership to the White House tomorrow to get this done.  Hopefully, we can rise above partisan politics in order to support national security.<br>这一局面可以在一场45分钟的会议上得到解决。我已邀请国会领袖明天来白宫完成这件事。希望我们能够超越党派政治，支持国家安全。</p>
<p>Some have suggested a barrier is immoral.  Then why do wealthy politicians build walls, fences, and gates around their homes?  They don’t build walls because they hate the people on the outside, but because they love the people on the inside.  The only thing that is immoral is the politicians to do nothing and continue to allow more innocent people to be so horribly victimized.<br>有些人认为竖起一道屏障是不道德的。那为什么有钱的政界人士在他们家周围修建围墙、围栏和大门？他们建墙不是因为他们恨外面的人，而是因为他们爱里面的人。唯一不道德的事情就是政界人士无所作为，持续让更多无辜的民众受到可怕的伤害。</p>
<p>America’s heart broke the day after Christmas when a young police officer in California was savagely murdered in cold blood by an illegal alien, who just came across the border.  The life of an American hero was stolen by someone who had no right to be in our country.<br>美国人的心在圣诞节之后那天都碎了，加州一名年轻的警员被一个刚越过边境的非法外来者冷血而残忍地杀害。一位美国英雄的生命被某个无权进入我们国家的人夺走了。</p>
<p>Day after day, precious lives are cut short by those who have violated our borders.  In California, an Air Force veteran was raped, murdered, and beaten to death with a hammer by an illegal alien with a long criminal history.  In Georgia, an illegal alien was recently charged with murder for killing, beheading, and dismembering his neighbor.  In Maryland, MS-13 gang members who arrived in the United States as unaccompanied minors were arrested and charged last year after viciously stabbing and beating a 16-year-old girl.<br>Over the last several years, I’ve met with dozens of families whose loved ones were stolen by illegal immigration.  I’ve held the hands of the weeping mothers and embraced the grief-stricken fathers.  So sad.  So terrible.  I will never forget the pain in their eyes, the tremble in their voices, and the sadness gripping their souls.<br>日复一日，宝贵的生命被那些侵犯我们边境的人夺走。在加州，一名空军退伍军人遭到强奸，谋杀、被锤子殴打致死，凶手是一名有长期犯罪史的非法外来者。在乔治亚州，一名非法外来者最近被控谋杀，他杀害了他的邻居，并将其砍头和肢解。在马里兰州，小时候在没有大人陪伴下来到美国的MS-13帮派成员去年被抓获并被控罪，在此之前，他们残忍地刀扎和殴打了一名16岁少女。在过去几年中，我和数十个家庭见过面，他们亲爱的家人被非法移民夺走了。我握过满脸泪痕的母亲的手，拥抱过伤心欲绝的父亲。太悲伤了。太可怕了。我永远不会忘记他们痛苦的眼神、颤抖的声音和悲痛的灵魂。</p>
<p>How much more American blood must we shed before Congress does its job?<br>我们还要让多少美国人流血，国会才会做自己的本职工作？</p>
<p>To those who refuse to compromise in the name of border security, I would ask: Imagine if it was your child, your husband, or your wife whose life was so cruelly shattered and totally broken?<br>对那些拒绝以边境安全的名义而妥协的人，我想要问他们，想象一下，如果那些生命被残忍粉碎、被彻底摧毁的人是你的孩子、你的丈夫或你的妻子，你会怎么样。</p>
<p>To every member of Congress: Pass a bill that ends this crisis.<br>我想对国会每位成员说，请通过结束这场危机的法案。</p>
<p>To every citizen: Call Congress and tell them to finally, after all of these decades, secure our border.<br>我想对每位公民说，给国会打电话，告诉他们在过去了这几十年之后，让我们终于能有边境安全。</p>
<p>This is a choice between right and wrong, justice and injustice.  This is about whether we fulfill our sacred duty to the American citizens we serve.<br>这事关是与非、正义与非正义的抉择。这事关我们能否对我们所服务的美国公民履行自己的神圣使命。</p>
<p>When I took the Oath of Office, I swore to protect our country.  And that is what I will always do, so help me God.<br>当我宣誓就职时，我誓言保护我们的国家。我将一直这样做。愿神助我。</p>
<p>Thank you and goodnight.<br>谢谢你们，晚安。</p>
