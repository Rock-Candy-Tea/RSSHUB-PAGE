Note:To the comments below; I also don't really like the way that Brown is doing it, but it seems to be a pretty standard thing at a lot of schools. From my non-acceptances this year, less than half were prompt rejections - in my case, UT, UW, Stanford, and (if mid-March is prompt) Cornell. The pool of "undecided" schools was of a similar caliber mix as above, so it's hard to be mad at Brown for applying a common practice. Also, I can appreciate Jeff for explaining the situation for those who were just going off of hunches. Antagonizing him would be like killing the well-intended messenger.
