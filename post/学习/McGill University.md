Rejected via E-mail on 15 Mar 2021 Undergrad GPA: 3.25GRE General (V/Q/W): 0/0/0.00GRE Subject: n/a♦ Note:It was a long shot given they use cu*ulative rather than sub-GPAs. Had solid volunteering, SLP and academic references, and research experience. I would say the GPA needs to get you in the door, then they look at all your other materials. Best of luck everyone!
