The New York Times did a story today saying that various Republican groups, many of them outstanding, are rallying on false claims that conservative activists are finding that the best way to raise money and keep voters engaged is to make Donald J. Trump’s biggest fabrication, Election Fraud, their top priority.  <br><br>Sadly, the Election was Rigged, and without even going into detail, of which there is much, totally game changing.  Democrats could not get Republican Legislatures in Swing States to approve many of the voting changes which took place before the Election, which is mandated under the Constitution of the United States.  <br><br>For that reason alone, we had an Illegitimate Election.  The Supreme Court and other Courts were afraid to rule, they were “gutless,” and will go down in history as such.  No wonder so much money is being raised on this issue, and law-abiding people have every right to do so!
