Congratulations to Julia Letlow on her BIG win in Louisiana!  Despite running in a field with a dozen candidates, no runoff election is necessary because she received 65% of the vote—an incredible victory.<br><br>I am thrilled for Julia and the entire Letlow family.  Luke is looking down proudly from above.
