Know Thy Enemy: The Defining Characteristics of Progressivism <br>1. Rewriting of historic, apostolic Christianity.<br>2. Rejection of the authority of Scripture. <br>3. Redefining of Christian beliefs and creeds.<br>4. Reinterpretation of Church and Christian history. <br><br>Progressivism emphasizes “spirituality” over transformation. It emphasizes works over belief. Progressivism is 100% designed to subvert the Gospel of Christ with an imitation false gospel.
