<div>   
Trump Supporters who were arrested for trespassing into the Capitol Building on January 6th are being held WITHOUT bail, in solitary confinement, and delayed court dates.<br><br>They cannot charge them for anything other than trespassing, but are making an example of them and torturing them. THIS IS CRIMINAL! <br><br>Not a SINGLE Republican elected official has stood up for them or even questioned the Stalinist arrests, disgraceful cowards. <br><br>This is NOT okay!!!
