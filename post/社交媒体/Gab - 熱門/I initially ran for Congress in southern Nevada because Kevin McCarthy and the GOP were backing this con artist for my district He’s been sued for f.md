I initially ran for Congress in southern Nevada because Kevin McCarthy and the GOP were backing this con artist for my district. He’s been sued for fraud 5 times, 3 assaults on strangers, 3 domestic abuse calls, and a 4th instance that didn’t make the news where he punched his wife in the face in a bar in New Orleans in front of a bunch of people. We had to listen to his wife’s 911 tapes play nonstop on TV here and of course, what should have been an easy to flip district stayed blue.<br><br>Now he’s moved and suddenly become a “Texan” to run in a dead man’s special election to siphon more funds off another campaign. *THIS* is why I’ll be running as an independent under the Patriot Party banner next time. The GOP is dead and they have no intention of ever actually being there for the American People, clearly. It’s about time We the People flip these states from the inside out, and purge our country of this out of control corruption.<br><br><a href="https://gab.com/tags/PatriotParty" class="mention hashtag" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">#PatriotParty</a> <a href="https://gab.com/tags/Mindy2022" class="mention hashtag" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">#Mindy2022</a> <a href="https://gab.com/tags/1776Again" class="mention hashtag" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">#1776Again</a> <a href="https://gab.com/tags/AmericaFirst" class="mention hashtag" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">#AmericaFirst</a><br><img src="https://media.gab.com/system/media_attachments/files/069/424/917/original/e6419513d4364e3c.jpeg" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
