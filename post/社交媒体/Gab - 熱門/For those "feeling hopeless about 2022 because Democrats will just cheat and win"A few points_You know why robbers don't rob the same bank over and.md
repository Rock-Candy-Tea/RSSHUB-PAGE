For those "feeling hopeless about 2022 because Democrats will just cheat and win..."<br><br>A few points:<br><br>You know why robbers don't rob the same bank over and over again?  Because the second time the cops will be waiting.<br><br>There was nothing fancy about what the Democrats did in 2020.  They printed fake ballots, prevented anyone from watching the count and hacked the voting machines.  The ONLY reason they got away way with this robbery in broad daylight was that the Establishment GOP looked the other way.<br><br>It was a coup.<br><br>Did the RNC put even one lawyer on the case to prove fraud?  They have hundreds.  No, not even one.  They left Trump to swing in the wind.<br><br>Will, the GOP look the other way in 2022?<br><br>I sincerely doubt it.  In 2020 they were ousting Trump (while doing very well in the House).  In 2022, they would be ousting themselves, and folks, that ain't happening.<br><br>So no, 2022 won't be a repeat of 2020.  The circumstances are completely different (no Trump) and for the GOP, the stakes are MUCH higher.  If Democrats can get a supermajority by cheating in 2022, the GOP is finished forever.<br><br>Nope, ain't happening.  We could, and should have a VERY good midterm, assuming folks on our side don't just give up because it's "hopeless."<br><br>P.S., Democrats thought Trump cheated in 2016.  Did they just give up?  No they fought twice as hard and kicked our ass in 2018.  THAT'S what we need to do and stop this Debbie Downer talk.
