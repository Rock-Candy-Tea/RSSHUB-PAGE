As much as we love President Trump, we're willing to bet that his new social media site will NOT be a free speech platform. His advisors will surely want to avoid accusations that he welcomes "racists" on his platform, therefore their terms of service may even be stricter than Big Tech sites. A free speech site already exists and it's called Gab. The best thing Trump could do is join us here, not build Twitter 2.0.
