Those who feel bummed out and discouraged now will feel differently when the midterms roll around.  The wounds of 2020 are still fresh, but by 2022, Trump will have already had his own social media platform for over a year and Biden will have had almost 2 more years to make an ass of himself.<br><br>You may not feel hopeful or sparked now, but you will. :-)
