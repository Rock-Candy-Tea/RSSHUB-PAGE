<p>Telegram has reached <strong>400,000,000</strong> monthly users, up from 300 million a year ago.</p>
<p>Every day at least <strong>1.5 million</strong> new users sign up for Telegram. Features like <a href="https://telegram.org/blog/folders"><strong>folders</strong></a>, <strong>cloud storage</strong> and <a href="https://desktop.telegram.org/"><strong>desktop</strong></a> <a href="https://macos.telegram.org/"><strong>support</strong></a> make Telegram ideal for remote work and study during the quarantine. It's no wonder Telegram is the <strong>#1</strong> most downloaded social media application in over <strong>20</strong> countries â€“ people all over the world are switching to Telegram at an accelerating pace. </p>

<p>When we started Telegram <strong>7 years ago</strong>, we assumed that people will always choose <strong>freedom</strong> and <strong>quality</strong> over restrictions and mediocrity. As the gap in popularity between Telegram and its older competitors narrows, we find more and more validity in that original assumption. Thank you for being smart and free! </p>
<p>What's next, you might ask? The current <a href="https://telegram.org/blog/coronavirus">global lockdown</a> highlighted the need for a trusted video communication tool. Video calls in 2020 are much like messaging in 2013. There are apps that are either <strong>secure</strong> <em>or</em> <strong>usable</strong>, but not both. We'd like to fix that, and we will focus on bringing you <strong>secure group video calls</strong> in <strong>2020</strong>.</p>
<p>When will they be ready? You'll be the first to know when we're done, promise. So stop asking. <img class="emoji" src="https://telegram.org/img/emoji/40/F09F9888.png" width="20" height="20" alt="ðŸ˜ˆ" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></p>
<h3><a class="anchor" name="better-quizzes" href="https://telegram.org/blog/400-million#better-quizzes"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>Better Quizzes</h3>
<p>We added <a href="https://telegram.org/blog/polls-2-0-vmq"><strong>Quiz Mode</strong></a> to <a href="https://telegram.org/blog/polls">Telegram Polls</a> back in January, allowing users to flex their <a href="https://t.me/quizbot?start=GreatMinds">trivia</a> <a href="https://t.me/QuizBot?start=MemeQuiz">muscles</a>. In recent weeks, we witnessed a surge of more serious <strong>educational tests and quizzes</strong> created using <a href="https://t.me/quizbot">@QuizBot</a>. Today's update upgrades quizzes with <strong>educational features</strong>.</p>
<p>You can now add <strong>explanations</strong> that appear as users respond to quiz questions, helping them <strong>learn</strong> from their mistakes, or giving them more <strong>context</strong>. Explanations make Telegram quizzes suitable not only for <strong>testing knowledge</strong> â€” but also for <strong>spreading</strong> it.</p>

<p>With <strong>2 billion</strong> students currently away from schools, the world is in dire need of online educational tools. Weâ€™d like to contribute to solving this problem by creating a <strong>database of educational tests</strong> for all subjects and levels. To do that, today weâ€™re announcing a crowd-sourcing initiative in which we will distribute <strong>EUR 400,000</strong> among creators of educational tests.</p>
<p>To take part, use <a href="https://t.me/quizbot">@QuizBot</a> to create and publish an <strong>original educational test</strong> on <strong>any subject</strong> at any difficulty level, in <strong>any language</strong>. Feel free to choose anything from basic <em>Medieval European History</em> in English to <em>Mikrobiologie fÃ¼r Experten</em> auf Deutsch â€“ and add any media you require to your questions, but make sure all intellectual property rights are respected.</p>
<p>We will publish the quizzes you submit in a <strong>searchable directory</strong>. Based on their quality and popularity we will then announce the winners in several stages. Submissions for the first stage end on <strong>May 15</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Subscribe to the <a href="https://t.me/contest">@contest</a> channel for updates on this and other competitions we run. Last year alone, we distributed <strong>2 Million Euro</strong> among the winners of our contests. <img class="emoji" src="https://telegram.org/img/emoji/40/F09F92B0.png" width="20" height="20" alt="ðŸ’°" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></p>
