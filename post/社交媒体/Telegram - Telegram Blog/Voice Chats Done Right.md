<p>Since <strong>2013</strong>, we've been expanding the definition of <strong>Group Chats</strong>, adding features like <a href="https://telegram.org/blog/replies-mentions-hashtags">replies</a>, <a href="https://telegram.org/tour/groups#mentions">mentions</a>, <a href="https://telegram.org/blog/polls-2-0-vmq">polls</a>, <a href="https://telegram.org/blog/admin-revolution">admin tools</a>, <a href="https://telegram.org/blog/profile-videos-people-nearby-and-more#group-stats">statistics</a> – and allowing <strong>hundreds of thousands</strong> of members per group. Many of these features were later incorporated into other apps and redefined how people communicate.</p>
<p>Today, Telegram groups get an entire new dimension with <strong>Voice Chats</strong> – persistent conference calls that members can join and leave as they please. Our <a href="https://telegram.org/blog">12th update</a> in <strong>2020</strong> brings them to you just in time for remote Christmas carols.</p>

<h3><a class="anchor" name="voice-chats" href="https://telegram.org/blog/voice-chats#voice-chats"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>Voice Chats</h3>
<p><strong>Any Telegram group</strong> can now become a voice chat room that is always on. Voice Chats run in parallel to existing text and media-based communication, adding a <strong>live layer</strong> of ephemeral talk to the group. They can be used as virtual office spaces for teams or informal lounges for any community.</p>
<p>While Voice Chats are not group calls, they can achieve similar goals – at the same time offering <strong>flexibility</strong> instead of old school scheduling. In larger groups, they also provide serendipitous opportunities for talking to people.</p>

<p>Groups with active voice chats have a special bar at the top that shows <strong>who is talking</strong> at the moment (and even how loud they are). This can help you pick the right moment to join – like noticing your friends going over to the cooler.</p>

<p>After joining a voice chat, you are <strong>free to move around</strong> the app, browse conversations and send messages. You stay connected to the chat and the microphone controls remain on screen so that you can quickly mute and unmute yourself at any time.</p>
<p>If you're on <strong>Android</strong>, you can enjoy the full Voice Chat experience with a <strong>system-wide floating widget</strong> that shows your mic controls and who is currently talking, even when Telegram is in the background. Santa is on Android too – and he needs his sleigh navigator open at all times.</p>

<p>You can chat with whomever is online or invite more people via the handy menu. Voice Chats can accommodate <strong>a few thousand participants</strong>, which means they'll work for everything from consulting family members while out shopping to a massive live event.</p>
<p>Last but not least, Voice Chats show <strong>spectacular animations</strong>. To get these right, our designer had to sell his soul to the devil – and we think it was totally worth it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To create a Voice Chat and find your own unique way of using them, open the profile of any group where you're an admin, tap (⋯) or (⋮) and select <em>Start Voice Chat</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Like Telegram groups before them, we hope that Voice Chats will change the way people collaborate and keep in touch. In the coming weeks, we'll be refining them further, listening to your feedback, improving noise suppression, and adding more features like <strong>video</strong> and <strong>screen sharing</strong>. </p>

<h3><a class="anchor" name="feature-suggestion-platform" href="https://telegram.org/blog/voice-chats#feature-suggestion-platform"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>Feature Suggestion Platform</h3>
<p>Many Telegram features started out as user suggestions. To help identify potential new features and locate bugs within the app, we're launching a <strong>public</strong> <a href="https://bugs.telegram.org/"><strong>Bug and Suggestion Platform</strong></a>.</p>
<!--<div class="blog_image_wrap blog_medium_image_wrap">
  <a href="LARGE" target="_blank"><img src="SMALL" title="Wake up, Samurai. We have a bug to fix." alt="Bugs and Suggestions" srcset="LARGE , 2x" /></a>

<p>We'll be rolling out the ability to suggest new features and report bugs <strong>gradually</strong> to make sure each submission gets the attention it deserves. All Telegram users are already welcome to view existing entries and <strong>vote</strong> on them. </p>
<p>And that's all for today, we'll see you in 2021 or once we're done building the next big thing – whichever comes first.</p>
