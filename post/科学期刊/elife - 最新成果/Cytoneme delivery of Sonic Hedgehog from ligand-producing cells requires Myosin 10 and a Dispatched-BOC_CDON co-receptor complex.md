Sonic Hedgehog is transported inside cytonemes with co-receptors that promote contact-mediated signal delivery to initiate rapid, receptor-dependent responses in recipient cells.

      <p class="paragraph">Morphogens function in concentration-dependent manners to instruct cell fate during tissue patterning. The cytoneme morphogen transport model posits that specialized filopodia extend between morphogen-sending and responding cells to ensure that appropriate signaling thresholds are achieved. How morphogens are transported along and deployed from cytonemes, how quickly a cytoneme-delivered, receptor-dependent signal is initiated, and whether these processes are conserved across phyla are not known. Herein, we reveal that the actin motor Myosin 10 promotes vesicular transport of Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) morphogen in mouse cell cytonemes, and that SHH morphogen gradient organization is altered in neural tubes of <i>Myo10<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice. We demonstrate that cytoneme-mediated deposition of SHH onto receiving cells induces a rapid, receptor-dependent signal response that occurs within seconds of ligand delivery. This activity is dependent upon a novel Dispatched (DISP)-BOC/CDON co-receptor complex that functions in ligand-producing cells to promote cytoneme occurrence and facilitate ligand delivery for signal activation.</p>
