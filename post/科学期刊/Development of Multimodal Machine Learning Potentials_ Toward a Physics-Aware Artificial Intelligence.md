                                    Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) are widely used for describing molecular energy and continue bridging the speed and accuracy gap between quantum mechanical (QM) and classical approaches like force fields. In this Account, we focus on the out-of-the-box approaches to developing transferable MLIPs for diverse chemical tasks. First, we introduce the “Accurate Neural Network engine for
