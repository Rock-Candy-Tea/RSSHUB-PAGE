                                    Enamine and enol ethers are nucleophilic functional groups that are well known to most chemists. When enamine or enol ethers are present in natural products, they are nearly exclusively found as derivatives having a direct connection to electron-withdrawing groups for stabilization, and the resulting larger entities, such as enamides or enol acylates, can be further extended or modified in the framework
