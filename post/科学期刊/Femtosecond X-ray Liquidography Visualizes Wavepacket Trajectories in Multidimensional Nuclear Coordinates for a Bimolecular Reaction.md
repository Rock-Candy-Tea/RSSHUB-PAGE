                                    Vibrational wavepacket motions on potential energy surfaces are one of the critical factors that determine the reaction dynamics of photoinduced reactions. The motions of vibrational wavepackets are often discussed in the interpretation of observables measured with various time-resolved vibrational or electronic spectroscopies but mostly in terms of the frequencies of wavepacket motions, which are
