                                    Inorganic nanocrystal design has been continuously evolving with a better understanding of the chemical reaction mechanisms between chemical stimuli and nanocrystals. Under certain conditions, molecular compounds can be effective as chemical stimuli to induce transformative reactions of nanocrystals toward new materials that would differ in geometric shape, composition, and crystallographic structure
