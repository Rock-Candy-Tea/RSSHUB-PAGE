                                    Macrolides are among the most widely prescribed antibiotics, particularly for bacterial lung infections, due to their favorable safety, oral bioavailability, and spectrum of activity against Gram-positive pathogens such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, the most common cause of bacterial pneumonia. Their utility against Gram-negative bacteria is extremely limited and does not include the Enterobacteriaceae
