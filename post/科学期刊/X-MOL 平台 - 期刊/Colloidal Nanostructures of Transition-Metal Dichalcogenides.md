                                    Layered transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are intriguing two-dimensional (2D) compounds where metal and chalcogen atoms are covalently bonded in each monolayer, and the monolayers are held together by weak van der Waals forces. Distinct from graphene, which is chemically inert, layered TMDs exhibit a wide range of electronic, optical, catalytic, and magnetic properties dependent upon their compositions
