                                    In biological systems, the storage and transfer of genetic information rely on sequence-controlled nucleic acids such as DNA and RNA. It has been realized for quite some time that this property is not only crucial for life but could also be very useful in human applications. For instance, DNA has been actively investigated as a digital storage medium over the past decade. Indeed, the “hard-disk of
