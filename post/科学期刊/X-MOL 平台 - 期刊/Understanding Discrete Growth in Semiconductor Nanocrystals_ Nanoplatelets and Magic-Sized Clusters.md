                                    Semiconductor nanocrystals (NCs) fluoresce with a color that strongly depends on their size and shape. Thus, to obtain homogeneous optical properties, researchers have strived to synthesize particles that are uniform. However, because NCs typically grow through continuous, incremental addition of material, slight differences in the growth process between individual crystallites yield statistical distributions
