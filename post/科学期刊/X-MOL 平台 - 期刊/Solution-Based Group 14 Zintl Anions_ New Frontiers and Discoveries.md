                                    Group 14 Zintl anions [Ex]q− (E = Si–Pb, x = 4, 5, 9, 10) are synthetically accessible, and their diverse chemical reactivity makes them valuable synthons in the construction of larger nanoclusters with remarkable structures, intriguing patterns of chemical bonding, and tunable physical and chemical properties. A plethora of novel cluster anions have now been isolated from the reactions of polyanionic
