                                    One of the biggest bottlenecks in modern drug discovery efforts is in tackling the undruggable proteome. Currently, over 85% of the proteome is still considered undruggable because most proteins lack well-defined binding pockets that can be functionally targeted with small molecules. Tackling the undruggable proteome necessitates innovative approaches for ligand discovery against undruggable proteins
