                                    Over the course of the past decade, our group has been intensely interested in achieving the laboratory synthesis of varied members of the coccinellid alkaloid family of natural products. These compounds, produced by varied species of ladybugs throughout the world as defensive agents, include several polycyclic members that can formally be considered as either monomeric or dimeric with architectures
