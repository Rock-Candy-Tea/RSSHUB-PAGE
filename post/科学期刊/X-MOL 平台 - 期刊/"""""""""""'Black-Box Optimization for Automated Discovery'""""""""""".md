                                    In chemistry and materials science, researchers and engineers discover, design, and optimize chemical compounds or materials with their professional knowledge and techniques. At the highest level of abstraction, this process is formulated as black-box optimization. For instance, the trial-and-error process of synthesizing various molecules for better material properties can be regarded as optimizing
