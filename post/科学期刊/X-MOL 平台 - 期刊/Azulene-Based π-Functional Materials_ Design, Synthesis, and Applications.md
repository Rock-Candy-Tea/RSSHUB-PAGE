                                    Azulene, an isomer of naphthalene, is a molecule of historical interest for its unusual photophysical properties, including a beautiful blue color derived from the narrow HOMO–LUMO energy gap and anti-Kasha fluorescence from S2 to S0. More recently, it has attracted increasing attention for its novel electronic structure, including an electron-rich five-membered ring and an electron-deficient seven-membered
