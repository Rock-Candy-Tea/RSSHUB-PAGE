<h2 class>Significance</h2><p id="p-4">Despite a relatively simple nervous system, jellyfish manage a broad range of motion from a distributed set of pacemakers, which initiate action potentials that form a wave of muscular activation to drive the bell motion. In this interdisciplinary study, we find that successful turning maneuvers are dependent on the speed of this activation wave. Using a three-dimensional computational fluid–structure interaction model, we demonstrate that setting the activation wave speed near the bell’s material wave speed, from the elastic wave equation, yields the strongest turning and margin hyperextension. This suggests an undescribed neuromechanical constraint on the bell, an important finding pertinent to the actuation of biomimetic vehicles and tissue-engineered pumps, as well as the biology of locomotion in flexible animals.</p><h2>Abstract</h2><p id="p-5">For organisms to have robust locomotion, their neuromuscular organization must adapt to constantly changing environments. In jellyfish, swimming robustness emerges when marginal pacemakers fire action potentials throughout the bell’s motor nerve net, which signals the musculature to contract. The speed of the muscle activation wave is dictated by the passage times of the action potentials. However, passive elastic material properties also influence the emergent kinematics, with time scales independent of neuromuscular organization. In this multimodal study, we examine the interplay between these two time scales during turning. A three-dimensional computational fluid–structure interaction model of a jellyfish was developed to determine the resulting emergent kinematics, using bidirectional muscular activation waves to actuate the bell rim. Activation wave speeds near the material wave speed yielded successful turns, with a 76-fold difference in turning rate between the best and worst performers. Hyperextension of the margin occurred only at activation wave speeds near the material wave speed, suggesting resonance. This hyperextension resulted in a 34-fold asymmetry in the circulation of the vortex ring between the inside and outside of the turn. Experimental recording of the activation speed confirmed that jellyfish actuate within this range, and flow visualization using particle image velocimetry validated the corresponding fluid dynamics of the numerical model. This suggests that neuromechanical wave resonance plays an important role in the robustness of an organism’s locomotory system and presents an undiscovered constraint on the evolution of flexible organisms. Understanding these dynamics is essential for developing actuators in soft body robotics and bioengineered pumps.</p>
