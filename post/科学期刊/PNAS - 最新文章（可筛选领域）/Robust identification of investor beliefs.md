<h2 class>Significance</h2><p id="p-6">Prices in asset markets reflect a combination of investor beliefs and their risk preferences. Researchers, as well as policymakers, look to asset market data as a barometer of public beliefs. Such data are informative because investors must be compensated for exposure to macroeconomic shocks, and thus beliefs about future macroeconomic performance are encoded in asset prices. This paper develops a method informed by data and models to recover information about investor beliefs. Our approach uses information embedded in forward-looking asset prices in conjunction with asset pricing models. We entertain families of potential belief distortions bounded by a statistical measure of divergence. Additionally, our method allows for the direct use of sparse survey evidence to make these bounds more informative.</p><h2>Abstract</h2><p id="p-7">This paper develops a method informed by data and models to recover information about investor beliefs. Our approach uses information embedded in forward-looking asset prices in conjunction with asset pricing models. We step back from presuming rational expectations and entertain potential belief distortions bounded by a statistical measure of discrepancy. Additionally, our method allows for the direct use of sparse survey evidence to make these bounds more informative. Within our framework, market-implied beliefs may differ from those implied by rational expectations due to behavioral/psychological biases of investors, ambiguity aversion, or omitted permanent components to valuation. Formally, we represent evidence about investor beliefs using a nonlinear expectation function deduced using model-implied moment conditions and bounds on statistical divergence. We illustrate our method with a prototypical example from macrofinance using asset market data to infer belief restrictions for macroeconomic growth rates.</p>
