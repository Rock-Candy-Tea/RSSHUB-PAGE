space. This is an artistic interpretation of a neuron releasing extracellular vesicles
(EVs). The green lights depict a fluorescent fusion protein (syb2-pHluorin) that is
transported via EVs and then incorporated into synapses (as shown in the top right
corner). In this issue of Neuron, Vilcaes et al. (pages 971–983) found that neuronal
EVs contain synaptic proteins and discovered that, once incorporated by other neurons,
they can modulate the properties of neurotransmitter release at synapses. This is
a novel form of inter-neuronal communication." referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></div>
