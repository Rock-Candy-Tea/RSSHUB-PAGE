The prevalence of open-angle glaucoma (OAG) varies from 0.5% to 7.0% among populations of diverse ancestry, suggesting the existence of genetic differences. The purposes of this study were to provide insights into genetic causes of OAG, which can result in prevalence and phenotype differences among populations of diverse ancestry for OAG, and to compare allele frequencies of intraocular pressure (IOP) elevation-related SNPs in OAG among Koreans and other ethnic groups.                 We collected the data on a total of 135 OAG-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from a genome-wide association studies (GWAS) catalog. The population-level allele frequencies of these SNPs were derived based on the 1000 Genomes Project and Korean Reference Genome Database. We used Fisher's exact test to assess whether the effect allele at a given SNP was significantly enriched or depleted.                 European, American, and South Asian populations showed similar heatmap patterns, while African, East Asian, and Korean populations had distinct patterns. Korean population presented different profiles compared to other groups; rs1579050 (FMNL2 gene), rs2024211 (CAV2;CAV1), and rs8141433 (GNB1L;TXNRD2 gene), which are known to be associated with IOP variation, were enriched in Americans, Europeans, and Africans, and depleted in Koreans. These can be the candidates for the causative genes of differences in the prevalence of IOP variation in OAG according to ethnic groups.                 Differences in allele frequencies associated with IOP related SNPs between Koreans and other ethnicities were observed, which may explain the high prevalence of OAG with normal IOP predominantly in Koreans and East Asians.
