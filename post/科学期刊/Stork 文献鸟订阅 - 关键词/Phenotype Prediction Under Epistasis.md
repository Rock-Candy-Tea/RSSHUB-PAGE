Reliable methods of phenotype prediction from genomic data play an increasingly important role in many areas of plant and animal breeding. Thus, developing methods that enhance prediction accuracy is of major interest. Here, we provide three methods for this purpose: (1) Genomic Best Linear Unbiased Prediction (GBLUP) as a model just accounting for additive SNP effects; (2) Epistatic Random Regression BLUP (ERRBLUP) as a full epistatic model which incorporates all pairwise SNP interactions, and (3) selective Epistatic Random Regression BLUP (sERRBLUP) as an epistatic model which incorporates a subset of pairwise SNP interactions selected based on their absolute effect sizes or the effect variances, which is computed based on solutions from the ERRBLUP model. We compared the predictive ability obtained from GBLUP, ERRBLUP, and sERRBLUP with genotypes from a publicly available wheat dataset and respective simulated phenotypes. Results showed that sERRBLUP provides a substantial increase in prediction accuracy compared to the other methods when the optimal proportion of SNP interactions is kept in the model, especially when an optimal proportion of SNP interactions is selected based on the SNP interaction effect sizes. All methods described here are implemented in the R-package EpiGP, which is able to process large-scale genomic data in a computationally efficient way.
