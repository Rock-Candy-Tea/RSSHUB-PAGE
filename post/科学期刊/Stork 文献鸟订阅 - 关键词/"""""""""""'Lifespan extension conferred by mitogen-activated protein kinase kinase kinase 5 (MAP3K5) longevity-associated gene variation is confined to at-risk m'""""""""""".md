Genetic variants of the kinase signaling gene MAP3K5 are associated with longevity. Here we explore whether the longevity-association involves protection against mortality in all individuals, or only in individuals with aging-related diseases. We tested the strongest longevity associated single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs2076260, for association with mortality in 3,516 elderly American men of Japanese ancestry. At baseline (1991-1993), 2,461 had either diabetes (n=990), coronary heart disease (CHD; n=724), or hypertension (n=1,877), and 1,055 lacked any of these cardiometabolic diseases (CMDs). The men were followed from baseline until Dec 31, 2019. Longevity-associated genotype CC in a major allele homozygote model, and CC+TT in a heterozygote disadvantage model were associated with longer lifespan in individuals having a CMD (covariate-adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 1.23 [95% CI: 1.12-1.35, p=2.5x10-5] in major allele homozygote model, and 1.22 [95% CI: 1.11-1.33, p=1.10x10-5] in heterozygote disadvantage model). For diabetes, hypertension and CHD, HR p-values were 0.019, 0.00048, 0.093, and 0.0024, 0.00040, 0.0014, in each respective genetic model. As expected, men without a CMD outlived men with a CMD (p=1.9x10-6). There was, however, no difference in lifespan by genotype in men without a CMD (p=0.21 and 0.86, respectively, in each genetic model). In conclusion, we propose that in individuals with a cardiometabolic disease, longevity-associated genetic variation in MAP3K5 enhances resilience mechanisms in cells and tissues to help protect against cardiometabolic stress caused by CMDs. As a result, men with CMD having longevity genotype live as long as all men without a CMD.
