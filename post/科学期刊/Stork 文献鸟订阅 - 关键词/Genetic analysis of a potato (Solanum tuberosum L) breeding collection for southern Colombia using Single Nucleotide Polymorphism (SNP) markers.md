Detailed knowledge on genetic parameters such as diversity, structure, and linkage disequilibrium (LD) and identification of duplicates in a germplasm bank and/or breeding collection are essential to conservation and breeding strategies in any crop. Therefore, the potato genetic breeding collection at the Universidad de Nariño in Colombia, which is made up of diploid and tetraploid genotypes in two of the more diverse genebanks in the world, was analyzed with 8303 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) from SolCAP version 1. In total, 144 genotypes from this collection were analyzed identifying an 57.2% of the polymorphic markers that allowed establishing two and three subpopulations that differentiated the diploid genotypes from the tetraploids. These subpopulations had high levels of heterozygosity and linkage disequilibrium. The diversity levels were higher in the tetraploid genotypes, while the LD levels were higher in the diploid genotypes. For the tetraploids, the genotypes from Peru had greater diversity and lower linkage disequilibrium than those from Colombia, which had slightly lower diversity and higher degrees of LD. The genetic analysis identified, adjusted and/or selected diploid and tetraploid genotypes under the following characteristics: 1) errors in classification associated with the level of ploidy; 2) presence of duplicates; and 3) genotypes with broad genetic distances and potential use in controlled hybridization processes. These analyses suggested that the potato genetic breeding collection at the Universidad de Nariño has a genetic base with a potential use in breeding programs for this crop in the Department of Nariño, in southern Colombia.
