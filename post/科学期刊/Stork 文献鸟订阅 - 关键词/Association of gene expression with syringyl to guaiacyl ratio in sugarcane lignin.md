A transcriptome analysis reveals the transcripts and alleles differentially expressed in sugarcane genotypes with contrasting lignin composition. Sugarcane bagasse is a highly abundant resource that may be used as a feedstock for the production of biofuels and bioproducts in order to meet increasing demands for renewable replacements for fossil carbon. However, lignin imparts rigidity to the cell wall that impedes the efficient breakdown of the biomass into fermentable sugars. Altering the ratio of the lignin units, syringyl (S) and guaiacyl (G), which comprise the native lignin polymer in sugarcane, may facilitate the processing of bagasse. This study aimed to identify genes and markers associated with S/G ratio in order to accelerate the development of sugarcane bioenergy varieties with modified lignin composition. The transcriptome sequences of 12 sugarcane genotypes that contrasted for S/G ratio were compared and there were 2019 transcripts identified as differentially expressed (DE) between the high and low S/G ratio groups. These included transcripts encoding possible monolignol biosynthetic pathway enzymes, transporters, dirigent proteins and transcriptional and post-translational regulators. Furthermore, the frequencies of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were compared between the low and high S/G ratio groups to identify specific alleles expressed with the phenotype. There were 2063 SNP loci across 787 unique transcripts that showed group-specific expression. Overall, the DE transcripts and SNP alleles identified in this study may be valuable for breeding sugarcane varieties with altered S/G ratio that may provide desirable bioenergy traits.
