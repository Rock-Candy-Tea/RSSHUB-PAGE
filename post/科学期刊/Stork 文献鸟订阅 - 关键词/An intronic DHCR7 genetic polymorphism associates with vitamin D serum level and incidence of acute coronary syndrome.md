Vitamin D deficiency has been linked to cardiovascular pathologies including acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Polymorphisms in vitamin D associated genes have been confounding to vitamin D serum levels and pathological predispositions. 7-hydrocholesterol is a common precursor in cholesterol and vitamin D synthesis. DHCR7/NADSYN1 genetic locus expresses 7-hydrocholesterol reductase (DHCR7), an enzyme that recruits 7-hydrocholesterol in cholesterol biosynthesis, and NAD synthetase 1 (NADSYN1), which participates in the hydroxylation of 25 hydroxyvitamin D.                 This study aims to correlate two polymorphisms in the DHCR7/NADSYN1 genetic locus with levels of circulatory vitamin D and the presentation of ACS in an Egyptian population.                 In a case control study, 189 ACS patients and 106 healthy control subjects were genotyped for SNPs rs11606033 of the DHCR7 gene and rs2276360 of the NADSYN1 gene using the amplification-refractory mutation system (ARMS). The levels of 25(OH)D2 and 25(OH)D3 were measured using an in-house developed and validated ultra-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) based protocol.                 ACS patients have significantly lower levels of circulating vitamin D in comparison to healthy controls. Allele A of the DHCR7 polymorphism was found to correlate with serum vitamin D deficiency and incidence of ACS classes: NSTEMI, STEMI and unstable angina, when compared to allele G. On the other hand, the NADSYN1 polymorphism rs2276360 correlated with serum 25(OH)D3 deficiency. Yet, no significant correlation was found with incidences of ACS.                 We conclude that rs11606033, which is an intronic SNP between exon 4 and exon 5 of the DHCR7 gene, influences vitamin D serum abundance and more importantly ACS incidence.
