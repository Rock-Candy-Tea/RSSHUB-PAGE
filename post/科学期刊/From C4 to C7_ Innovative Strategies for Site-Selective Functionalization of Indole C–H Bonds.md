                                    The widespread presence of hydrocarbons makes C–H functionalization an attractive alternative to traditional cross-coupling methods. As indole is an important heteroarene in a plethora of natural products and pharmaceuticals, C–H functionalization of indole moieties has emerged as one of the most important topics in this field. Due to the presence of multiple C–H bonds in indoles, site selectivity
