Soluble cytokine receptors can influence immune responses by modulating the biological functions of their respective ligands. These effects can be either agonistic or antagonistic and a number of soluble cytokine receptors have been shown to play critical roles in both maintenance of health and disease pathogenesis. Soluble IL-7Ra (sCD127) is one such example. With its impact on the IL-7/CD127 pathway, which is fundamental for the development and homeostasis of T cells, the role of sCD127 in health and disease has been extensively studied in recent years. Within this review, the role of sCD127 in maintaining host immune function is presented. Next, by addressing genetic factors affecting sCD127 expression and the associated levels of sCD127 production, the roles of sCD127 in autoimmune disease, infections and cancer are described. Finally, advances in the field of soluble cytokine therapy and the potential for sCD127 as a biomarker and therapeutic agent are discussed.                 © 2021 Barros et al.
