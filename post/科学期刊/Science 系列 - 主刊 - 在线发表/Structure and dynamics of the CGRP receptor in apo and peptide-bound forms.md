                  <h2>Abstract</h2><p id="p-3">G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are key regulators of information transmission between cells and organs. Despite this, we have only limited understanding of the behavior of GPCRs in the apo state and the conformational changes upon agonist binding that lead to G protein recruitment and activation. We expressed and purified unmodified apo and peptide-bound calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptors to determine their cryo-EM structures and complemented these with analysis of protein conformational dynamics using hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) and 3D variance analysis of the cryo-EM data. Together with our previously published structure of the active, Gs-bound, CGRP receptor complex, our work provides important insight into mechanisms of class B1 GPCR activation.</p>
