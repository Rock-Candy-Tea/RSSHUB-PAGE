Bardet–Biedl syndrome 3 (BBS3) protein promotes phospholipase D to load onto the BBSome at the ciliary tip for moving out of the cilium via intraflagellar transport.

      <p class="paragraph">Certain ciliary signaling proteins couple with the BBSome, a conserved complex of Bardet–Biedl syndrome (BBS) proteins, to load onto retrograde intraflagellar transport (IFT) trains for their removal out of cilia in <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i>. Here, we show that loss of the Arf-like 6 (ARL6) GTPase BBS3 causes the signaling protein phospholipase D (PLD) to accumulate in cilia. Upon targeting to the basal body, BBSomes enter and cycle through cilia via IFT, while BBS3 in a GTP-bound state separates from BBSomes, associates with the membrane, and translocates from the basal body to cilia by diffusion. Upon arriving at the ciliary tip, GTP-bound BBS3 binds and recruits BBSomes to the ciliary membrane for interacting with PLD, thus making the PLD-laden BBSomes available to load onto retrograde IFT trains for ciliary exit. Therefore, BBS3 promotes PLD exit from cilia via the BBSome, providing a regulatory mechanism for ciliary signaling protein removal out of cilia.</p>
