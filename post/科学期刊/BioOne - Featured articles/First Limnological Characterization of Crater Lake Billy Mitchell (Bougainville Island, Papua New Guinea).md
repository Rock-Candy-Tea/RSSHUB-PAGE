Physicochemical depth profiles indicated mixis of the entire water body with oxygen saturation reaching 55% in the deepest layers. A shallow thermocline was eroded at night, indicating atelomixis. <a target="_blank" href="https://bioone.org/journals/Pacific-Science/volume-71/issue-1/71.1.3/First-Limnological-Characterization-of-Crater-Lake-Billy-Mitchell-Bougainville-Island/10.2984/ContentImages/Journals/pasc/71/1/71.1.3/graphic/fi01_29.gif"><img alt="fi01_29.gif" style="display: inline;" src="https://bioone.org/journals/Pacific-Science/volume-71/issue-1/71.1.3/First-Limnological-Characterization-of-Crater-Lake-Billy-Mitchell-Bougainville-Island/10.2984/ContentImages/Journals/pasc/71/1/71.1.3/graphic/WebImages/fi01_29.gif" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></a>, Cl<sup>−</sup>, <a target="_blank" href="https://bioone.org/journals/Pacific-Science/volume-71/issue-1/71.1.3/First-Limnological-Characterization-of-Crater-Lake-Billy-Mitchell-Bougainville-Island/10.2984/ContentImages/Journals/pasc/71/1/71.1.3/graphic/fi02_29.gif"><img alt="fi02_29.gif" style="display: inline;" src="https://bioone.org/journals/Pacific-Science/volume-71/issue-1/71.1.3/First-Limnological-Characterization-of-Crater-Lake-Billy-Mitchell-Bougainville-Island/10.2984/ContentImages/Journals/pasc/71/1/71.1.3/graphic/WebImages/fi02_29.gif" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></a> and Na<sup>+</sup>, Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Mg<sup>2+</sup> were the dominant anions and cations, respectively, leading to a conductivity of around 1,230 µS cm<sup>−1</sup>. The pH was close to neutral throughout the water column, and no accumulation of CO<sub>2 </sub>was observed at greater depths. With a total phosphorus concentration of around 25 µg liter<sup>-1</sup> the lake can be considered as meso- to eutrophic. The phytoplankton community consisted of 18 taxa. The dinophyte <i>Peridiniopsis</i> cf. <i>penardii</i> and the filamentous green alga <i>Planctonema lauterbornii</i> dominated in the uppermost layer and reached a total biovolume around 16 mm<sup>3</sup> liter<sup>-1</sup>. Six macrophyte taxa were found (three Spermatophyta/three Bryophyta), with the water chestnut <i>Eleocharis dulcis</i> covering the shoreline and <i>Ceratophyllum demersum</i> spreading to at least 3 m depth. Seven ciliate species were detected (<5 individuals ml<sup>-1</sup>) with bacterivorous scuticociliates and the prostomatid <i>Coleps hirtus hirtus</i> dominating the assemblage. The micrometazoan plankton community comprised the rotifer <i>Anuraeopsis fissa</i>, the copepod <i>Mesocyclops</i> cf. <i>affinis</i>, and a cladoceran species within the <i>Ceriodaphnia cornuta</i> group all concentrating in the upper water column. The only fish species found in the lake was the eel <i>Anguilla megastoma</i>, whereas in the effluent river this species occurred together with <i>Anguilla marmorata</i>.</p></text>
