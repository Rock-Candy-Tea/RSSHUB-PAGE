                        <text class="ArticleContentText"><!-- *** Custom HTML *** --><p class="first" id="ID0EF">Examination of bycatch in traps used for adult mosquito control surveillance and bycatch in larval sampling jars, over the past 21 yr, has revealed a number of new distribution records for arthropods. The literature is reviewed, and new distribution information is presented for 98 species of Diptera, 35 species of Copepoda, 14 species of Lepidoptera, and 1 species each of Hemiptera, Hymenoptera, and Amphipoda. Among the new information generated are new records for the United States, new records for Florida, range extensions, a new phoretic association, and at least eight undescribed species, five of which have been described and named. Examination of bycatch can provide basic identification on species distribution and seasonal abundance that might otherwise go undetected. About one-third of Florida mosquito control programs that responded to a survey indicated that bycatch from surveillance was examined. There was a moderate association between presence of a biologist or entomologist on staff and examination of bycatch. Florida mosquito control programs may be able to help fill knowledge gaps related to the state's arthropod fauna.</p></text>
