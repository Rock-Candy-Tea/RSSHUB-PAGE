Other major species showed little change in abundance or basal area. The <span class="genus-species">Carpinus</span> decline was greater at low elevations suggesting the importance of flooding. <span class="genus-species">Carpinus</span> is rated among the least flood-tolerant species in the system. It differs from other species of similar flood tolerance in adult stature (midstory) and shade tolerance (tolerant).</p><p id="ID0EFB">  <b>Conclusions:</b> The trade-off between flood tolerance and shade tolerance can influence dynamics of floodplain forests.</p><p id="ID0EJB">  <b>Nomenclature:</b> <a class="internal-link" href="https://bioone.org/journals/journal-of-vegetation-science/volume-19/issue-6/2008-8-18460/The-trade-off-between-flood-and-shade-tolerance--A/10.3170/2008-8-18460.full#i1100-9233-19-6-739-b14">Burns & Honkala (1990)</a> except for <span class="genus-species">Ilex decidua</span> Walt.</p></text>
