The present study was designed to detect the L1014F <i>kdr</i> (knockdown resistant) mutation among <i>Cx. quinquefasciatus</i> populations in the filarial belt of Sri Lanka. Mosquitoes were reared from field-caught larvae from seven localities where LF is endemic. Susceptibility status of <i>Cx. quinquefasciatus</i> to adulticides, 0.05% deltamethrin, 0.75% permethrin, 5% malathion, and the larvicide temephos was determined using the standard WHO susceptibility tests. A fragment of <i>vgsc</i> gene was amplified and sequenced to identify the responsible <i>kdr</i> mutations. The susceptibility test results revealed less than 90% mortalities for 0.05% deltamethrin, and 0.75% permethrin and temephos. For 5% malathion, all study sites except Maharagama revealed greater than 90% mortality. The L1014F <i>kdr</i> mutation was observed in all studied populations. Although the overall microfilaria rate is less than 1% in the country, there is a high risk of re-emergence of LF in Sri Lanka due to abundant <i>Cx. quinquefasciatus</i> mosquitoes, increased resistant status to currently used insecticides, imported LF cases, higher rates of microfilaria among neighboring countries, and the advancement of tourism.</p></text>
