It is assumed that, in the primordial plasma, at the temperatures above the
mass of electron, fermions are in the neutral state being the superposition of
particle and antiparticle. There exists neutral proton-electron symmetry.
Proton-electron equilibrium is defined by the proton-electron mass difference.
At the temperature equal to the mass of electron, pairs of neutral electrons
annihilate into photons, and pairs of neutral protons and electrons survive as
protons and electrons.
