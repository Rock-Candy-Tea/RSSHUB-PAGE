<div>   
We present a class of exactly solvable models of correlated electrons. The
models are defined in any dimension $d$ and consist of electron-hopping terms
and local attractive interactions between electrons. For each even number of
electrons less than or equal to $1/(d+1)$-filling, we find the exact ground
state in which all electrons form pairs of a certain type, and thus the models
exhibit an electron-pair condensation.
