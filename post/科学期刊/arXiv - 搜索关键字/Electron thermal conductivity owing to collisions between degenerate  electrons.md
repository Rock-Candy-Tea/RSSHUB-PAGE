We calculate the thermal conductivity of electrons produced by
electron-electron Coulomb scattering in a strongly degenerate electron gas
taking into account the Landau damping of transverse plasmons. The Landau
damping strongly reduces this conductivity in the domain of ultrarelativistic
electrons at temperatures below the electron plasma temperature. In the inner
crust of a neutron star at temperatures T < 1e7 K this thermal conductivity
completely dominates over the electron conductivity due to electron-ion
(electron-phonon) scattering and becomes competitive with the the electron
conductivity due to scattering of electrons by impurity ions.
