                                    Donor–acceptor (D–A) cyclopropanes have gained increased momentum over the past two decades. The use of these highly strained three-membered entities paved the way to innovative and original transformations yielding complex cyclic and acyclic architectures that otherwise might be difficult to address. Since the fundamentals were laid by Wenkert and Reissig in the late 1970s, the field has flourished
