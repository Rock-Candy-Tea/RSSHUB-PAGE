<p>Nonprofit organizations provide an array of important social goods and services including arts, education and health care. Consequently, the nonprofit sector is a growing area of interest for management and strategy scholars. Existing theories of nonprofit organizations posit a menu of profit-deviating objective functions that attempt to explain below-cost pricing but raise several problems for management and strategy. Importantly, the literature provides scant guidance on how nonprofit managers should choose from the menu, and this in turn raises problems for competitors trying to strategize against them. This article maintains that nonprofits can be modeled as profit-maximizers in two-sided markets, now known as multi-sided platforms (MSPs). We present a formal model to demonstrate how this theory, so influential in the technology sector, can also explain nonprofit behavior. MSP theory offers an extensive toolkit that can be applied to a variety of strategic decisions. Future work would examine how MSP theory can be used to explain the tremendous heterogeneity within the nonprofit sector as well as key differences between for-profits and nonprofits.</p>
