                  <h2 class>Smoke alarm</h2><p id="p-2">Intense, widespread bushfires in Australia injected huge amounts of smoke into the stratosphere in 2020. Hirsch and Koren found that this smoke caused record-breaking levels of aerosols over the Southern Hemisphere, as much as that from a moderate volcanic eruption. The severity was caused by a combination of the vigor of the fires and their location at a latitude with a shallow tropopause and within the midlatitude cyclones belt. This aerosol increase caused considerable cooling over oceanic cloud-free areas.</p><p id="p-3"><em>Science</em>, this issue p. <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/lookup/doi/10.1126/science.abe1415">1269</a></p><br><h2>Abstract</h2><p id="p-5">The early months of 2020 showed record-breaking levels of aerosol optical depth (AOD) over the Southern Hemisphere (SH). Apart from the tropics, monthly AOD values over most of the SH exceeded the average by more than three standard deviations. This anomalous AOD is attributed to a combination of the intensity and location of the Australian bushfires. The fires took place south enough, where the tropopause altitude is relatively low, within the mid-latitude cyclone belt. This location allowed for deep convection over and downwind of the fires, which transported the smoke to the stratosphere, where its lifetime is an order of magnitude longer than it would have been in the lower atmosphere. The lower bound of the stratospheric smoke mass in January 2020 was ~2.1 ± 1 teragrams, which lead to cooling by more than 1.0 ± 0.6 watts per square meter over cloud-free oceanic areas.</p>
