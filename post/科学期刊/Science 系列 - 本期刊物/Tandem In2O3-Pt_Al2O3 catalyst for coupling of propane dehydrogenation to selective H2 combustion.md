                  <h2 class>Overcoming propylene oxidation</h2><p id="p-2">Catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene and water become less selective with increasing conversion because propylene itself is more readily oxidized than propane. Yan <em>et al.</em> created nanoscale tandem catalysts by growing an ∼2-nanometer shell of indium oxide, a selective hydrogen combustion catalyst, over a propane dehydrogenation catalyst, platinum nanoparticles supported on alumina spheres (see the Perspective by Pei and Gong). This overcoat exposed the platinum nanoparticles for propane dehydrogenation. Surface hydrogen atoms were oxidized at the indium oxide–platinum interface. This approach boosted yields of propylene to up to 30%.</p><p id="p-3"><em>Science</em>, this issue p. <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/lookup/doi/10.1126/science.abd4441">1257</a>; see also p. <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/lookup/doi/10.1126/science.abh0424">1203</a></p><br><h2>Abstract</h2><p id="p-5">Tandem catalysis couples multiple reactions and promises to improve chemical processing, but precise spatiotemporal control over reactive intermediates remains elusive. We used atomic layer deposition to grow In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> over Pt/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, and this nanostructure kinetically couples the domains through surface hydrogen atom transfer, resulting in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) to propylene by platinum, then selective hydrogen combustion by In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, without excessive hydrocarbon combustion. Other nanostructures, including platinum on In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> or platinum mixed with In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, favor propane combustion because they cannot organize the reactions sequentially. The net effect is rapid and stable oxidative dehydrogenation of propane at high per-pass yields exceeding the PDH equilibrium. Tandem catalysis using this nanoscale overcoating geometry is validated as an opportunity for highly selective catalytic performance in a grand challenge reaction.</p>
