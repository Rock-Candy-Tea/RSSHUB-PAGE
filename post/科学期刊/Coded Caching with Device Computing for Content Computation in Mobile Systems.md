Edge caching and computing have been regarded as an efficient approach to tackle the wireless spectrum crunch problem. In this paper, we design a coded caching with device computing scheme for content computation, e.g., VR rendering, to minimize the average transmission bandwidth. Because both coded data and stored data can be the data before or after computing, the proposed scheme has numerous ed...
