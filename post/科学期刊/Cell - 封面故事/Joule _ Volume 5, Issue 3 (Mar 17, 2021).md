and dissipate heat, thereby increasing the module temperature. This can increase the
module and system cost by lowering its electrical output and shortening the module
lifetime. From the cost perspective, once the power conversion efficiency is approaching
a practical upper limit, work on the control and mitigation of the module temperature
can be equally or even more significant than costly marginal gains in power conversion
efficiency. Cover art by Ivan Gromicho. Scientific Illustrator, Research Communication
