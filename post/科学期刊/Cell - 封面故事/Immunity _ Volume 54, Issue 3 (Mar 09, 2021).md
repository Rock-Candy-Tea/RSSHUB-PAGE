disease-relevant functions is challenging in part due to the difficulty of assessing
the antigen specificity of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. In this issue of <em>Immunity</em>, Chiou, Tseng, et al. (586–602) report the development of a platform that enables
comprehensive analysis of T cell specificities and accelerates antigen discovery.
Analysis of ∼800,000 T cell receptor (TCR) sequences from 178 lung cancer patients
resulted in more than 400 shared TCR specificity groups that were clonally expanded
and enriched in tumor compared to adjacent lung. TCR sequences are depicted as randomly
colored balls in a “search” machine that scans tumors for shared TCR specificity groups,
depicted as colored cubes on a conveyor belt. Artwork by Gerardo Sotillo and Noel
Alvarez (Llum Dimensions)." referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></div>
