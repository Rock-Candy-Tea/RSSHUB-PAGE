feedstocks and viewed as a structural hybrid of seven- and five-membered lactone rings,
activates (lights up) both pathways, leading to high polymerizability and depolymerizability
depending on which lactone ring is visualized for the ring-opening (of the seven-membered
ring) and ring-closing (forming the five-membered ring) processes. Thus, such a hybrid
monomer structure uniquely unifies often conflicting properties that are challenging
to improve or optimize concurrently in a single monomer structure by exhibiting high
polymerizability and also leading to circular polymers with not only high recyclability
but also robust performance properties. For more information, see the article by Chen
and co-workers on page 670. Cover art courtesy of Ella Maru Studio." referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></div>
