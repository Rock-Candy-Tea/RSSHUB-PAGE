the transgenerational transmission of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) in mice occurs
via altered DNA methylation and that there are common hypomethylation signatures in
humans. Treatment of the offspring in mice with a methylating agent rescues the major
reproductive neuroendocrine and metabolic alterations of the disease. The cover image
illustrates the developmental programming (outline of a pregnant woman: red DNA strand)
of PCOS. The blue and three white spheres represent methyl groups and symbolize the
transmission of hypomethylation to the next generation. Design concept by Isabel Paiva
and Paolo Giacobini; image credit: Filipa Paiva." referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></div>
