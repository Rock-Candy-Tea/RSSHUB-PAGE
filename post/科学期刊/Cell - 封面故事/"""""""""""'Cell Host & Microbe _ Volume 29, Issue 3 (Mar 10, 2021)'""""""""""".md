presumably favoring the emergence of α-Gal-specific immunity. In this issue of <em>Cell Host & Microbe</em>, Singh et al. (347–361) show that, in mice, the absence of this glycan enhances resistance
to sepsis via an increased antibody-effector function despite an associated reproductive
cost. The cover shows the primate evolutionary tree across a field of glycans: Old
World primates enter a landscape where α-Gal (in yellow) is lost with eyes set on
their path to survival. Illustration by Joana C. Carvalho." referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></div>
