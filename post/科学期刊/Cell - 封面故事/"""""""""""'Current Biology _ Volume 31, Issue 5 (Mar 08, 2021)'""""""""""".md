the parasitic plant <em>Sapria himalayana</em> Griff. represents the most extreme form of plant parasitism. Members of this plant
family, Rafflesiaceae, lack leaves, stems, and roots, and acquire all of their nutritional
requirements directly from their obligate hosts. In this issue, Cai et al. (pages
1002–1011) report a genome assembly of this species and identify that an astonishing
44% of conserved plant genes are lost, dwarfing levels of loss reported in all other
plants. These gene losses show remarkable functional convergence among parasitic plants,
suggesting a common genetic roadmap underlying this life history. The genome also
demonstrates widespread evidence of horizontal transfer, revealing a dynamic history
of former host associations. Photograph © Chainarong Phrammanee; used with permission." referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></div>
