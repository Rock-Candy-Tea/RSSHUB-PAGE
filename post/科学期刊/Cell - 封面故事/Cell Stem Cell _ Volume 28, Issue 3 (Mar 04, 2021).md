artwork, but this organelle also takes center stage in direct astrocyte-to-neuron
reprogramming, when a fifth of the mitochondrial proteome should be exchanged, as
shown by Russo et al. (524–534) in this issue. Blue astrocytes and neurons, the starter
and end cell types in this process, surround the mitochondrion, and Russo et al. show
that their conversion can be boosted up to 4 times by using CRISPR-mediated activation
of only few neuron-enriched mitochondria proteins, symbolized by the orange particles
floating in the picture. The authors thank Marina Mungial for the artwork. This issue
also includes five review and Forum articles that highlight the regulation of metabolism
in stem cells by mitochondria and lysosomes, under normal and disease conditions.
They provide a view of current ideas related to the emerging role that cellular metabolism
plays in stem cell biology and the technologies that are used in this discipline." referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></div>
