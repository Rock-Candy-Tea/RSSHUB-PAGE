<div>   
This paper considers massive connectivity in asynchronous systems, where a large number of devices sporadically send data to the base station (BS) with imperfect synchronization. Grant-free random access is considered and each device is assigned with a unique but not necessarily orthogonal pilot sequence for identification and channel estimation. The goal is to design algorithms for joint user act...
