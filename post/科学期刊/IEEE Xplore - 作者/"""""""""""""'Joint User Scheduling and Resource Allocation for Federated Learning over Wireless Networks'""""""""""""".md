Federated learning (FL) is a decentralized algorithm that can train a globally shared model without the requirement to send the raw data to a centralized server by user equipments (UEs). Consider the UEs with non-independently and identically distributed (non-IID) data, heterogeneous computational capabilities and wireless channel conditions, FL becomes unproductive over a wireless network. In thi...
