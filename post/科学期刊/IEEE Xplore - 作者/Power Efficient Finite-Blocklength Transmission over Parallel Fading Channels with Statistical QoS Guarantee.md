This paper studies the power efficient transmission with finite blocklength over parallel fading channels under queueing constraints by leveraging the concept of effective capacity. Instantaneous channel state information (CSI) is assumed available at the transmitter so that rate-adaptive channel coding is performed across the multiple parallel fading channels. We first obtain a closed-form lower ...
