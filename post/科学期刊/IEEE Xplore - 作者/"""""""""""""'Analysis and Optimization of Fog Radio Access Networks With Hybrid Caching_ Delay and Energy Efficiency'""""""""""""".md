In this article, delay and energy efficiency (EE) are investigated in fog radio access networks (F-RANs) with hybrid caching. With multiple caching and transmission strategies, hybrid caching offers great flexibility for file placement and file fetching. By using tools from stochastic geometry, we firstly derive tractable expressions of delay for coded cached, non-partitioned cached and uncached f...
