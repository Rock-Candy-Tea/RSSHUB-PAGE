Coded caching is effective in leveraging the accumulated storage size in wireless networks by distributing different coded segments of each file in multiple cache nodes. This paper aims to find a wireless coded caching policy to minimize the total discounted network cost, which involves both transmission delay and cache replacement cost, using tools from deep learning. The problem is known to be c...
