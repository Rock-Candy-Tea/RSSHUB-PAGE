This work investigates the distributed task offloading problem in a mobile edge computing network with a massive number of users and one single base station (BS). Each user can decide, in a distributed manner, whether to compute its task locally or to offload to a common edge server equipped at the BS for execution. If edge computing, the user transmits its task data along with a unique but potent...
